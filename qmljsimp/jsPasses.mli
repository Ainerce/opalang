   This module contains some passes for the javascript AST.

type jsp = JsAst.code -> JsAst.code

(**
   Transform recursive code element on element code using [tailrec_machine].
   Replace call to function by call using the [t] and [tco] function prototype

   cf ["qmlJsfunClientLib.js"]
   for the implementation of prototype [t] and [tso].

   This transformation is made in 2 kind of location for function applications:

   1) in terminal call position, instead of beeing recursive, and returning a call to itself,
   it returns potentially a [TailCall] object, containing the rest of the execution to
   process, using the prototype [tco] of the [Function] class.

   2) in other call positions, instead of calling the function direclty (it would not type
   because the function potentially has previously returned a [TailCall] object instead of
   the restul) it used the prototype [t] of the [Function] class, which loops until the
   final result is returned.

   This function makes an alpha renaming on each local value:
   -function parameters
   -local function variables
   -local letin

   using a short ident generator, using a reset for each toplevel declaration,
   for keeping identifier short, even on a huge code.

   Split too deep expressions.
