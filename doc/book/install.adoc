At the time of this writing, Opa is available for MacOS X and Linux. A Windows port is in the works and Opa should also work on
a number of other operating systems (e.g. BSD) but these platforms are not supported for the moment.

Installing Opa
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easiest solution for installing Opa is to download an installer from http://opalang.org/download.html[our website].

MacOS X
^^^^^^^

- If you have not done so yet, install the XCode tools, provided by Apple with your copy of MacOS X. If you do not have XCode, you can either download the latest version from the http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id422352214?uo=2&mt=12&uo=2&v0=WWW-NAUS-ITUHOME-NEWAPPLICATIONS[Mac AppStore] (paying) or download an older version from https://daw.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/DSAuthWeb.woa/wa/login?appIdKey=D635F5C417E087A3B9864DAC5D25920C4E9442C9339FA9277951628F0291F620&path=/%2Fmembercenter%2FurlRedirect.action%3FfullURL%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fconnect.apple.com%252Fcgi-bin%252FWebObjects%252Fregister.woa%252F49%252Fwa%252Fdefault%253Fmode%253Dregister%2526userAction%253Dlogin%2526successURL%253Dhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fconnect.apple.com%25252Fcgi-bin%25252FWebObjects%25252FMemberSite.woa%25252Fwa%25252Flogin%25253Faction%25253DgetSoftware%2525253FbundleID%2525253D20792[Apple's website] (free, registration required). In addition to general development utilities, this package provides some of the low-level, Mac-specific, tools used by Opa to produce server-side executables.
- Download http://www.opalang.org/downloads[Opa for MacOS X].
- Once the download is complete, if your browser does not open automatically the file you have just downloaded, go to your Download folder and open this file. This should open a new Finder window containing the Opa installer package.
- Open the Opa installer package by double-clicking on it.
- Follow the instructions on screen. You will need the password of an administrative account.
- Once the installation is complete, the Opa compiler will be installed in directory

  /opt/mlstate

and symbolic links will be created in +/usr/local/bin+ hence you should not have to modify your PATH variable to enjoy the Opa compiler and its tools.

Ubuntu Linux, Debian Linux
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following instructions are also valid for all Debian-based Linux distributions.

- Download the Ubuntu Linux package from http://www.opalang.org/download.html.
- Once the download is complete, your operating system will offer you to install Opa using a tool such as gdebi or kdebi.
- Follow the instructions on sreen. You will need the password of an account with administration rights.
- Once the installation is complete, the Opa compiler will be installed in directory

  /usr/bin

and the documentation and examples will be in

  /usr/share/doc/opa

Other Linux, installing as user
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To install Opa on Suse, Red Hat, Fedora and other distributions of Linux which
do not use the .deb system, or if you don't have administrative rights on your
machine, take the following steps:


- Using your package manager, install packages:
**    +libssl-devel+
**    +zlib1g-devel+

- Or, if these packages do not exist in your distribution, install whichever packages provide
**  library +libssl.so+
**  library +libz.so+

- Download the Linux self-extracting package from http://www.opalang.org/download.html.
- When prompted by your browser, choose to save the file in a temporary directory, for instance, +/tmp+.
- To install as user:
** Set the execution permission on the downloaded program
** Run it and follow the instructions on screen
** The compiler is installed by default in ~/mlstate-opa/bin
- To install system-wide, open a terminal (if you are using KDE, the terminal is called Konsole)
** In the terminal, write:

    sudo sh [complete path to the file you have just downloaded]

** Follow the instructions on screen
** By default, the install is done in /usr/local
- This installation comes with an uninstall script, in [install prefix]/share/opa/uninstall.sh

Building Opa from source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[CAUTION]
==========
Work in progress
==========

Should you wish to work on an unsupported platform, or to contribute to Opa, you will need to build Opa from source. This requires a bit more work than the
installation, but you should have no major difficulties. You will need:

- git (to download the source);
- libgif 4.1 or ulterior (dev version)
- libjpeg 8b-1 or ulterior (dev version)
- libpng 1.2.44 or ulterior (dev version)
- libssl 0.9.8 or ulterior (dev version)
- libxft 2.2.0 or ulterior (dev version)
- m4
- dblatex
- java 1.5 or ulterior
- libx11 1.4.2 or ulterior (dev version)
- zlib 1.2.3.4 or ulterior (dev version)

In addition, if you are using MacOS X, you will need

- GNU coreutils, part of http://macports.org[MacPorts] (free)
- The XCode suite, provided by Apple with your copy of MacOS X. If you do not have XCode, you can either download the latest version from the http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id422352214?uo=2&mt=12&uo=2&v0=WWW-NAUS-ITUHOME-NEWAPPLICATIONS[Mac AppStore] (paying) or download an older version from https://daw.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/DSAuthWeb.woa/wa/login?appIdKey=D635F5C417E087A3B9864DAC5D25920C4E9442C9339FA9277951628F0291F620&path=/%2Fmembercenter%2FurlRedirect.action%3FfullURL%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fconnect.apple.com%252Fcgi-bin%252FWebObjects%252Fregister.woa%252F49%252Fwa%252Fdefault%253Fmode%253Dregister%2526userAction%253Dlogin%2526successURL%253Dhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fconnect.apple.com%25252Fcgi-bin%25252FWebObjects%25252FMemberSite.woa%25252Fwa%25252Flogin%25253Faction%25253DgetSoftware%2525253FbundleID%2525253D20792[Apple's website] (free, registration required). This package provides some of the low-level, Mac-specific, tools used by Opa to produce server-side executables.

Once these dependencies are satisfied, take the following steps:

- Grab the source on http://github.com/MLstate/opalang[github]

  - In a terminal, enter
------
git clone git@github.com:MLstate/opalang.git
------

  - In the same terminal, enter
------
cd opalang
./configure --prefix=SOMEDIRECTORY
make
make install
------

(You will need root privileges). This will install Opa in directory _SOMEDIRECTORY_


Setting up your editor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The package you installed provides two Opa modes, one for Emacs and one for Vim.

Emacs
^^^^^

On MacOS-X, either you're using Aquamacs and the package installation took care of it, or you should add the following line to your configuration file (which might be +~/.emacs+).

------
;; MLstate
(autoload 'opa-mode "/Library/Application Support/Emacs/site-lisp/opa-mode/opa-mode.el" "OPA editing mode." t)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.opa$" . opa-mode))
------

Onn Linux, it's easy as 1 2 3, add the following lines to your configuration file:

------
;; MLstate
(autoload 'opa-mode "/usr/share/opa/emacs/opa-mode.el" "OPA editing mode." t)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.opa$" . opa-mode))
------

Vim
^^^

If your running linux (resp. MacOS-X), copy files +/usr/share/opa/vim/{ftdetect,syntax}/opa.vim+ (resp. +/opt/mlstate/share/opa/vim/{ftdetect,syntax}/opa.vim+) in your +.vim+ directory, keeping directory structure, of course.
That's it !!

[TIP]
==============
Instead of copying you can create a symbolic link. This will let you be automatically up-to-date with the latest mode everytime you install Opa from a new Opa package.
==============

Other editors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Although we do not provide configuration files for other editors yet, we would be very happy to hear about it.
