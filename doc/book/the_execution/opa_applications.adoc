Accessing privileged system resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When developing your application, it is perfectly acceptable (and even
recommended) to test it on user-allowed ports, as the default port
8080. However, when your application is ready and you want to deploy it and show
it to the world, you will probably need to allow it to use port 80, as well as
some other privileged ports, depending on your application.

There are basically two ways to do that:

* Run your application with the root account. This will work, as with any other
user, and Opa will not attempt to drop privileges. Although we did our best to
make Opa as secure as possible, and you certainly did the same for your
application, it is a bit uncomfortable to run a full application with
administrative rights. Consequently, we do not advise this solution.
* Run your application in user-land, and handle privileged actions with specific
tools. This is much safer and often more flexible. There are at least two very
different ways to do that:
** use authbind to allow your application to access directly a privileged port;
** or put a priviledged dispatcher in front of your application (e.g.  HAProxy or Nginx).


Debugging resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[section_runtime_editable_resources]]

Opa applicaions support the following command-line options, which can be used to make generated files editable at runtime:

 -  --debug-editable-js makes the compiled JS editable at runtime; [[runtime_arg_debug_editable_js]]
 -  --debug-editable-css makes the compiled CSS editable at runtime; [[runtime_arg_debug_editable_css]]
 -  --debug-editable-file f makes embedded file f editable at runtime; [[runtime_arg_debug_editable_file]]
 -  --debug-editable-all makes everything editable at runtime; [[runtime_arg_debug_editable_all]]
 -  --debug-list-resources lists the resources that can be made editable. [[runtime_arg_debug_list_resources]]

Each of these options creates a directory _'opa-debug'_, which contains all the editable files. If a file (other than JS) is already present, it is reused instead of the embedded file. Otherwise, the file is created with the contents embedded in the executable. Now, if the file is modified, it is automatically reloaded (without having to relaunch the server) and is immediately visible on the client.

By the way, if a debug file is removed during the execution of the server,
this file is automatically recreated, without having to relaunch the server.
We also log any change to the application logs.

Of course, the file is never saved back into the executable. You'll need recompilation for this kind of thing.
