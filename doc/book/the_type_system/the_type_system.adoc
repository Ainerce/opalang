Opa type system overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.Strong typing

Opa is a *statically* and *strongly* typechecked language. This means
that the type of an expression is computed once and for all at compile-time,
an expression has one unique type and this type can't be used as another one.
In Opa, any expression evaluates into a value and functions are first class
values. This means that, like integers, booleans, strings in other languages,
functions in Opa can be passed as arguments, returned as results, stored in
data-types, and so on.


.Type inference

Opa compiler offers *type inference*, i.e. it automatically determines
the type of expressions from the context, without the user needing to write these
types. Hence, a definition like
[source,opa]
------------------------
x = 5
------------------------
will lead ++x++ to have the type ++int++ because the integer literal ++5++ is
known to be of type ++int++, this type representing the type of integer values.

As a bit more complex example, the function
[source,opa]
------------------------
chose(cond, if_true, otherwise) = if cond then if_true else otherwise
------------------------
will be found having the type
[source,opa]
------------------------
(bool, int, int) -> int
------------------------
where +bool+ represents the type or boolean values
and +->+ is the function taking arguments of the types
stated on the left side and returning a result of the type stated on the right
side of the arrow symbol.


.Polymorphism

The type system of Opa features *polymorphism*, i.e. types in which some parts
are not constrained and can be of any type. For instance, the identity function:
[source,opa]
------------------------
identity(x) = x
------------------------
doesn't set any constraint on it argument's type:
it can safely be applied to any kind of value and will return this kind of
value. Its type will then be +'a -> 'a+ where +'a+ is a *type variable*,
i.e. "_any type will do for 'a_". Using +identity+ with an
integer as argument will then instantiate +'a+ with +int+. Using +identity+
with a boolean will then instantiate +'a+ with +bool+.


.Records and sums

In addition to usual data-types (integers, booleans, string, floating point
numbers), Opa provides two cornerstone structures: *records* and
*sums*.
A *record* can be seen as a +struct+ in C, i.e. a non-ordered sequence of
fields packed into one global entity. However, conversely to C these records
can be either "_closed_" or "_opened_": the list of fields can be fixed or can
contain "at least" the ones stated in the record type.
A *sum* is a set of possible "cases", each case being a record. Hence, a sum
allows to express the fact that a data-structure can be of different shapes. This
can be compared to +union+ in C, with the difference that the effective shape
of the data is directly embedded inside its representation.


.Type abstraction

In the Opa system, *type abstraction*, i.e. ability to hide the actual
structure of a type is provided thanks to the notions of *private* and
*abstract* types. The first ones are types that only have an existence in
the package where they are defined; they are not visible outside this package.
The second ones are transparently visible (i.e. their structure can be
manipulated) only in the package where they are defined; outside this package,
they become opaque, i.e. are still visible but their internal structure is not
visible anymore.


.Modularity

Opa provides a certain notion of *module*, i.e. packages containing value
definitions via a particular form of records. Such records are syntactically
marked as being modules and will get a particular type called *type forall*.
Under some restrictions due to typechecking decidability, it is possible to
use these modules like regular record, hence passing them through functions or
returning them as result.




Type inference: a "slight" restriction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Type inference is not complete for some parts of Opa features and
a few type annotations are required from the user. This is mostly due to the
expressiveness of the language that provides very flexible features at the price
of the non-existence of a principal type. Existence of a principal type means
that there is always one "_better_" type, i.e. all the other types that could be
chosen for an expression would reduce the contexts where this expression can
be used. In such a case, the user will have to indicate himself the type he
wishes using a type annotation to enforce the expression to be of this type.
This construct is called a *coercion*. On the other side, coercion by type
annotations may also be required when the
typechecker infers a cyclic type. In effect, such types are internally used by
the typechecker but are not currently allowed outside in the language.




[[Opa_type_algebra]]
Opa type algebra
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As previously stated, expressions evaluate to values of certain types. The
type algebra describes the shape of these types. The present section doesn't
explains how types are synthesized from expressions even if some examples are
given. We rather address here an intuitive presentation of the types.



Constant types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Natively, Opa provides three basic types:

- +int+ : The type of signed integer values (e.g. +0+, +-4+).
- +string+ : The type of characters strings (e.g. +"this is a string"+).
- +float+ : The type of signed floating point values (e.g. +0.489+, +-5.94+).



[[type_variable]]
Type variable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As stated in introduction, type variables are used to represent
types with not particular constraint,
i.e. types we don't need to know about or we don't know yet their effective
internal structure. Type variables are written by a leading quote followed by
regular identifier, for instance: +'a+, +'myvar5+.

Type variables act in two particular parts of the type system.

* During type inference, they are used by the typechecker to temporarily give
  types to expressions that at a certain point do not exhibit the need to have
  a particular type.
* At the end of type inference of a definition, type variables that still
  remain unconstrained are "_generalized_". This means that the typechecker
  discovered that there is no need to know more about the structure of the
  types they represent and hence decides to make the type polymorphic: any type
  will be suitable in place of these variables. Hence, in the type of a
  definition (not expression), all finally appearing type variables are
  implicitly quantified by a "_for all_" qualifier, telling that the definition
  having this type has all the possible *type schemes* where type variables
  can be instantiated (replaced) by any type. In other words, a type scheme is
  a "_model_", a "_pattern_" of types, describing a "_family_" of possible types.
  + 
  This last point raises an important concept:
  - **Expressions** have a **type**.
  - **Definitions** have a **type scheme**.
  + 
  In other words:
  - In an expression a type variable is just an *unknown* that may one day be
    known equal to some type.
  - In a definition a type variable is a *universally quantified type*. Each
    instance, usage of the identifier bound by this definition is free to
    replace these variables by types it needs in its context.



Function type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A function is characterized by the type of its arguments and the type of its
result. The type constructor for a function is the "_arrow_" symbol: +->+. On the
left part the types of the arguments are listed, comma-separated if there are
several arguments. On the right part is the type of the result of the function.

Examples:

- +-> int+ : Function taking no argument and returning an integer.
- +int -> bool+ : Function taking one argument of type integer and returning a
  boolean.
- +int, string -> string+ : Function taking two arguments, the first one being
  of type integer, the second of type characters string and returning a
  characters string.
- +int, (int -> bool), int -> bool+ : Function taking three arguments, the
first and third ones being of type integer, the second one being a function
taking an integer and returning a boolean. Finally, the function returns a
boolean. Note the presence of parentheses enclosing the function type of the
second argument.



Named type
^^^^^^^^^^
Types can be inductively combined to form complex data-types and bound to names
thanks to *type definitions*. Hence, the following extract defines a new type
name +natural+, whose structure is +int+.

[source,opa]
------------
type natural = int
------------

Once this type is defined, we may use type name +natural+ to denote this new
type.

Types can have parameters. For instance, the type of pairs with their two
components being of a same type can be defined as:
[source,opa]
-------------
type same_comp_pair_ty('a) = ('a, 'a)
-------------
A pair denoted by the type +same_comp_pair_ty(float)+ will have its two
components carrying floating point numbers.

The type of pairs with components of any types can be defined as:
[source,opa]
-------------
type same_comp_pair_ty('a,'b) = ('b, 'a)
-------------
Note that the order of the type variables +'a+ and +'b+ is different in the
quantification (i.e. left-part of the definition, on the left of the +=+ sign)
and in the body of the type definition. As a result, this means that pairs
having type ++same_comp_pair_ty(int, bool)++ will carry integers in their second
component and booleans in their first component.

Finally the type of relational operators (i.e. functions taking two arguments
of the same type and returning a boolean value) can be defined as:
[source,opa]
-------------
type relational_ty('a) = 'a, 'a -> bool
-------------

Following this definition, the type of relational operators testing integers
is +relational_ty(int)+.

Hence, a named type is an identifier followed by as many types comma-separated
and enclosed between parentheses as the corresponding type definition has
parameters.

See also the section dealing with
<<type_definitions_section, type definitions>>.


[[algebra_sum_type]]
Sum type
^^^^^^^^
Sums are a sequence of cases, each case being a record type.

A record is a sequence of typed fields. In a record, accessing a fields will
yield a value of the type of this field. Sums as record can be either *closed*
of *opened*. A *closed* record type (respectively sum) enumerates exactly the
fields it contains (respectively cases for a sum). An *opened* record type
(respectively sum) enumerates the fields (respectively cases for a sum) it may
contain at minimum, and allows to have more if needed. In case of opened record
or sum, the type ends by a trailing ellipsis, otherwise it is silently closed.

An *opened* sum ends by a *column variable*, i.e. a kind of type variable that
can be instantiated by another sum. In other words, this column variable allows
the sum to gain more sum cases.

An *opened* record ends by a *row variable*, i.e. a kind of type variable that
can be instantiated by another record (also called "__row__"). In other words,
this row variable allows the record to gain more fields.

In error messages (where they need to be clearly named), column variables
(resp. row variables) are denoted by ++'c.a++, ++'c.b++, etc
(resp. ++'r.a++, ++'r.b++, etc). In other cases, when types are printed and
the identity of such variables doesn't matter, they are both written "...".

Here follow some examples of correct record types :

- +{ }+ : Empty record type. It contains no field.
- +{ x : int ; y : float }+ : Closed record containing exactly the two fields +x+
   of type +int+ and '+y+ of type +float+.
- +{ x : int ; ... }+ or +{ x : int ; ... }+ : Opened record type containing at
   least a field '+x+ of type +int+ and possibly any other fields of any type.

Sums are a form of sequence of records. They can be non-disjoint, meaning that
some records forming cases may overlap.

[IMPORTANT]
A strong restriction imposes that an *opened sum* must not host
*any* case that is an opened record and any (*closed or opened*) *sum* must not
host *several* cases that are opened records.
Moreover, if several cases (i.e. records) of a sum share a same label, this label
must have the same type in each cases. Finally, if a sum has several cases,
none of them must be opened.

Here follow some correct sum types examples:

- +{ a : int } / { b : float }+ : Closed sum containing two cases, one being a
  record having exactly one field +a+ of type +int+, the second begin a record
  containing a record having exactly a field +b+ of type +float+.
- +{ a : int } / ...+ : Opened sum containing at least one case being a record
  having exactly a field +a+ of type +int+ and possibly any other cases.
- +{ a : int } / { a : int ; b : float }+ : Closed sum containing exactly two
  cases, one being a record containing exactly one field +a+ of type +int+, the
  second being a record containing exactly two fields, +a+ of type +int+ and
  +b+ of type +float+. We see in this example that fields can be common to
  several cases as long they keep the same type. For example, having +a+ of
  type +bool+ in one of the cases would be ill-typed.
- +{ a : int } / { a : int ; b : float } / ...+ : Opened sum type similar to
  the previous example. It may contains additional other cases compared
  to the previous example.
- +{ a : int }+ : Closed sum with only one case. It can be hence seen as a
  "record" (i.e. like a +struct+ a la C) exactly containing one field +a+ of type
  +int+.
- +{ a : int ; ... }+ : Closed sum with only one case. This case is opened
  hence can be seen as a record containing at least one field +a+ of type
  +int+. Any other record containing additional fields is compatible with
  this type.



[[type_forall_expl]]
Type forall
^^^^^^^^^^^^
We saw in section <<type_variable, Type variable>> the difference between *types*
and *type schemes*. Variables present in type schemes are universally
quantified, hence a type scheme represent a family of types. A *type forall*
embeds a type scheme inside a type and represents the type of a module field.
Such a type is written by prefixing its body by the keyword +forall+ followed
by the list of polymorphic type variables of the type between parentheses
followed by a "+.+" (dot) then the body of the type. Type-forall are in fact a
way to introduce a flavor of rank-2 polymorphism in Opa type system.

Rank-2 polymorphism is a system in which a forall quantifier
may not appear to the left of more than 2 arrows (when the type is drawn as a
tree). To illustrate this concept, consider the function:
[source,opa]
------------
f(x) = x
_ = (f (true), f(2))
------------
variables bound with a definition (sometimes called "__let-definition__" may be
polymorphic, as in ++f++ above. That's the reason why ++f++ can be applied to two
different types, ++bool++ and ++int++.
However, in a rank-1 polymorphism system, function arguments may not be:

[source,opa]
------------
g(f) = (f(true), f(2))
------------
results in an error:
[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------------
[black]__**Error**
Function was found of type [red]##bool -> 'a## but application expects it to be of
type [red]##int -> 'b##.
Types [red]##int## and [red]##{ false } / { true }## are not compatible__
--------------------------------------

In a rank-2 polymorphism system, we can give ++g++ a signature like
++(forall a. a -> a) -> (bool, int)++. This is called a rank 2 type, because a
function argument is polymorphic, as indicated by the forall quantifier. Now the
function ++g++ may be applied to expression whose generalized type is at least
as general as that declared.

Modules are particular records in which each field type gets generalized. This
way, a module can be seen as a package of definitions grouped in the module
rather than laying at toplevel.

When a module field definition appears to be polymorphic, its type is turned
into a type forall where all generalizable variables are universally quantified.
The type of the module is hence a *closed* record type whose fields names are
the fields definitions names with their related type turned into a type forall
if they are polymorphic. Hence, types forall are closely related to module
fields types and can only be created via module expressions.

The following program clearly show the difference between the type of +r+ which
is a regular record and the one a +m+ which is a record containing types
forall for fields having a polymorphic type.

[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------------
r = {
  id(x) = x
  pair(x) = (x, x)
  one = 1
}
[black]__r : {id : 'v0 -> 'v0; pair : 'v1 -> tuple_2('v1, 'v1); one : int} / ... =
 { id = &lt;fun&gt; ; one = 1 ; pair = &lt;fun&gt; }__

m = {{
  id(x) = x
  pair(x) = (x, x)
  one = 1
}}
[black]__m : {id : forall('v0). 'v0 -> 'v0;
      pair : forall('v1). 'v1 -> tuple_2('v1, 'v1);
      one : int} =
 { id = &lt;fun&gt; ; one = 1 ; pair = &lt;fun&gt; }__
--------------------------------------

In the record type of +r+, no type forall appear even if the type scheme of
+r+ itself is polymorphic (+'v0+ and +'v1+ are generalized). In the record
type of +m+, since it is a module, all fields having a polymorphic type get
generalized and turned into forall types. One can notice that +one+ being
not polymorphic, it is not turned into a forall type.

[IMPORTANT]
Types forall are explicitly created by the developer when he uses a module
construct: there is hence no automatic type forall creation. Conversely, when
a type forall appears in an expression, it is automatically instantiated, hence
leading to a type in which generalized variables are replaced by fresh variables
and universal quantification disappears (in other words, the type forall
becomes a type "non"-forall again).



Opa type algebra formal grammar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For sake of completeness, we give here a presentation of the type algebra like
usually described in theoretical approaches. This section is mostly dedicated
to advanced users or people familiar with type systems design. A more complete
description of this theoretical presentation is available in the technical
and architecture documents of Opa.

[[typing_a_program]]
Typing a program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now that the form of Opa's types has been presented, we will address how Opa
programs are typechecked. The aim of this section is to understand the type
to expect for each construct of the language. This presentation is split in two
parts, one dealing with type definitions and one dealing with expressions.



[[type_definitions_section]]
Typing type definitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Type definitions allow to create new data-structure from previously existing
ones or allow to alias, i.e. provide a name as a shortcut for cumbersome type
expressions. Both usages follow the same syntax and rules.


Structure of a type definition
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
A type definition is introduced by:

[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------------
[__directive__] type [__directive__] __ident[__(__parameters__,__...__)__]__ = __type expression__
--------------------------------------

where _ident_ is the name of the created type, _parameters_ is a
comma-separated enumeration between parentheses of the type variables
parameterizing the definition (or nothing if the definition is not
parameterized), and _type expression_ is the body of the defined type. We will
see directives in the next section.

Once defined, the new type name will be compatible with itself and any
type expression compatible with the body of its definition. Hence, following
the definition +type t = int+, the type +t+ can be used anywhere an +int+ is
expected and reciprocally.


Directives in type definitions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Directives allow to alter the visibility of a type definition to ensure
abstraction. Two directives are available: ++@private++ and ++@abstract++.

- ++@private++ makes the type definition only visible in the package where it
  it defined. Outside this package, the type is no more visible : it doesn't
  exist for other packages. Such types are typically "internal tools" of a
  package and serve only to implement functionalities without appearing in
  the interface of the package. As a consequence, they must not escape outside
  the package, i.e. must not appear in the signatures of values visible outside
  the package. To make this possible, values manipulating such types must also
  be declared private, using the ++@private++ directive also available for
  value definitions. If a private type appears in the signature of an exported
  value, an error is raised, advising to make this value private, like in the
  following example:
[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------------
package private_ty_escape2
@private type prv_string_ty = string
vv = "" : prv_string_ty
[black]__**Error**
Description:
Definition of [red]##vv## is not private but its type contains a type private to the
package. Type [red]##prv_string_ty## must not escape its scope.
Hint:
  Add a @private directive on this definition.__
--------------------------------------

- ++@abstract++ makes the type definition transparently visible inside the
  package where it is defined, i.e. its internal structure can be accessed and
  manipulated, but outside this package it turns opaque: the type is still
  visible (i.e. it still exists) but its internal structure is not visible
  anymore.
  Such types are typically data-structures implemented in a package, provided
  to other packages that must not directly manipulate the effective
  implementation of the data-structure and instead use the API provided by the
  package implementing the data-structure. This is a kind of abstract data type
  (ADT), which permits to preserve consistency and internal invariants required
  by the implementation of a data-type. The basic idea is that the definition
  package "knows" how to safely manage the type, provides a safe API to the
  outer "world", hence one gets sure that nobody will come and "hack by hand",
  hence break, invariants required by the data-structure to keep consistent.
  Outside its definition module, an abstract type loses its internal
  representation, hence becomes compatible only with itself.
[source,opa]
--------------------------------------
package p1
@abstract type u = int
to_u(x : int) : u = x
from_u(x : u) = x : int
// Legal since we are in the defining package: we see u's internals.
_ = 1 + (1 : u)
--------------------------------------
[source,opa]
--------------------------------------
package p2
import p1
// Obtain a value of type u from the integer 0.
v = to_u(0)
_ = 1 + v
--------------------------------------
Because the last line of code of package ++p2++ tries to rely on ++u++'s
internal structure although it is not the package defining it, ++u++ being
turned abstract can't be compatible with ++int++ anymore, hence leading to the
error:
[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------------
[black]__**Error**
Function was found of type [red]##'a, 'a -> 'a## but application expects it to be of
type [red]##int, u -> 'b##.
Types [red]##int## and [red]##u## are not compatible__
--------------------------------------


Parameters in type definitions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Parameters allow to define types polymorphically, in order to instantiate them
later by providing effective type arguments to the type name in future type
definitions or type expressions. Let's examine the following sample code.

[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------------
type fun_t('a, 'b) = 'a -> 'b
type int_string_fun_t = fun_t(int, string)

twice_general(f , i) = f(i) + f(i)
[black]__twice_general : ('v0 -> int), 'v0 -> int = &lt;fun&gt; __

twice(f : fun_t(int, int), i) = f(i) + f(i)
[black]__twice : fun_t(int, int), int -> int = &lt;fun&gt; __
--------------------------------------

+fun_t+ is defined as the type of functions taking one argument an returning
a value, both of them not being fixed in the definition. Hence the type
+fun_t+ is "_partially defined_" and will need to be instantiated with
effective arguments in further usages.

Next comes the definition of +int_string_fun_t+ using +fun_t+ and specializing
this latter with +int+ for both the types of the argument and returned value of
the function. By this definition, we used the general +fun_ty+ to create a more
specialized type definition.

Let's now consider the definition of +twice_general+ taking a function, a
parametric value and adding twice the result of applying this function to this
value. The type of +++ (internally +int, int -> int+) enforces the result of
+f+ to be +int+ but no constraint applies on the type of the argument of
+f+. Hence +f+ has type +'v0 -> int+, and by consequence +twice_general+ also
has a parameterized type +('v0 -> int), 'v0 -> int+.

Using the type definition +int_string_fun_t+, we can define a function similar
to +twice_general+, i.e. with the same body but with a more restricted type:
+twice+.
Hence, by adding a type coercion on the parameter +f+ of +twice+, we can
enforce it to be of type +fun_t(int, int)+ hence forcing the parameter of +f+
to be +int+ instead of leaving it free like in +twice_general+.

[NOTE]
Note that both definitions of +fun_t+ and +int_string_fun_t+ do not really
create "new" types. They are aliases, "_shortcuts_" for a type expression.
Instead of using these 2 defined type names, we could directly use their body
but this would be less handy. Creation of really new types is achieved by
defining sums and records as described below.



Using type expressions in a type definition body
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The basic type expressions that can be used allow to represent the types
described in the <<Opa_type_algebra, Opa type algebra>>.

- *Basic constant named types* : +int+, +bool+, +string+, +float+,
      +void+. +
  ++type t = int++ defines +t+ as an alias on the type of integers +int+.

- *Function type* : +->+ +
  ++type t1 = int -> float++ defines +t1+ as the type of functions taking an
    +int+ and returning a +float+. +
  ++type t2 = -> float++ defines +t2+ as the type of functions taking no
    argument and returning a +float+. +
  ++type t3('a, 'b) = 'a -> 'b++ defines +t3+ as the type of functions taking
    an argument and returning a value whose types are not fixed and are
    parameters of the type definition. Hence, +t3(int, float)+ specializes these
    parameters and lead to a type compatible with the above type +t1+. +
  ++type t4 = int, string -> bool++ defines +t4+ as the type of functions taking
    two arguments (of types +int+ and +string+) and returning a +bool+.

- *Named type* +
  Type definitions bind type expressions to names. So defined type names can
  be on their turn used to form new type definitions. If a type name represents
  a parameterized type, it must be instantiated providing effective type
  arguments according to its arity (i.e. number of required arguments). +
  ++type t5 = t1 -> t2++ defines +t5+ as the type of functions taking a
    parameter of type +t1+ and returning a result of type +t2+, both types
    being those presented in the above paragraph. +
  ++type t6 = t3(bool, int)++ defines +t6+ using the previously defined type
    +t3+ and applying it to +bool+ and +int+. As a consequence, +t6+ is the
    type of functions taking an argument of type +bool+ and returning a value
    of type +int+.

- *Sum* +
  A sum type is an enumeration of "_cases_" separated by a "/" (slash character).
   Each "_case_" is a "_record_" i.e. an enumeration between braces of labels
   with their type. +
  ++type t7 = { A : int } / { B : string ; C : bool }++ defines +t7+ as a new
    sum type containing two "_cases_". The first one is a record containing a
    field +A+ of type +int+; The second one is a record containing two fields,
    +B+ of type +string+ and +C+ of type +bool+. Values of this type can be
    "_pattern matched_" to discriminate their effective form and access the
    particular fields of each case. +
    Sum type definitions always lead to "_closed_" sum, i.e. the resulting
    type doesn't ends by a "..." (column variable). This simply means that
    when defining a type, the definition simply describes all the "_cases_"
    this type can host. +
    As a shortcut, when a field of record has type +void+, its type
    specification can be ommited. Hence, +
  ++type color = { Red } / { Green } / { Blue }++ defines +color+ as a sum
    with three cases, each of them implicitly of type +void+. This is equivalent
    to ++{ Red : void } / { Green : void } / { Blue : void }++. The idea in
    such a definition is that the fields of the record are self-sufficient and
    do not need to carry additional information to be precise enough. +
  ++type pair('a, 'b) = { first : 'a ; second : 'b }++ defines +pair+ as a
    parameterized sum with only one "_case_". This "_case_" is a record
    containing two fields, one per component of the pair. Since the pair
    data-structure is naturally polymorphic, this type definition has in effect
    2 parameters +'a+ and +'b+.
[IMPORTANT]
Remember, as already state while presenting Opa type algebra, in the
<<algebra_sum_type, sum types section>>, that a strong restriction imposes that
an *opened sum* must not host *any* case that is an opened record and any
(*closed or opened*) *sum* must not host *several* cases that are opened records.
Moreover, if several cases (i.e. records) of a sum share a same label, this label
must have the same type in each cases. Finally, if a sum has several cases,
none of them must be opened.

- *Record* +
  A record type is defined like (and compatible with) a sum type with only one
  "_case_". This way, by default a record type is a closed row in an opened
  column.

- *Type forall* +
  Type-forall being strongly related to modules, they are defined using a
  syntax close to modules, allowing to avoid the explicit quantification of
  type variables. In fact, type-forall are not directly written, they are
  introduced on need through module types. Any type variable appearing in the
  type of a field of the definition and not bound outside will be implicitly
  considered as quantified. +
  ++type t = {{ identity : 'a -> 'a }}++ defines +t+ as a module type (i.e. a
  record) in which the field +identity+ has the type-forall
  +forall('a).'a -> 'a+. +
  Note that variables not bound outside the module type have a scope local to
  the field's type where they appear. For instance, in
  ++type t = {{ identity : 'a -> 'a ; val : 'a }}++, +'a+ represents 2
  different variables in +identity+ and +val+. +
  Variables bound outside the module type are not quantified, hence not
  participating into type-forall creation. For instance in
  ++type t('a) = {{ id : 'a -> 'a ; v : 'b }} -> 'a++ the type variable +'a+
  being a type parameter is bound outside the module type, hence is not
  quantified. By consequence, the type of the field +identity+ is no more a
  type-forall. Conversely, +'b+ being not bound remains quantified and
  introduces a type-forall. This also shows that type-forall are introduced
  only when polymorphism exists: there exists no "_trivial_" type-forall,
  i.e. no type-forall with an empty set of quantified variables.

A few syntactic extensions allow shortcuts to make life easier.

- *Sum sugar* +
Additionally, a syntactic shortcut allows to merge several sum types
definitions to create a new definition containing the "_cases_" of all the
initial types. In the same idea than when creating a sum type, i.e. separating
its different cases by a "/", the names of types to merge are simply separated
by a "/". +
++type t = { A } / { B }++ +
++type u = { C }++ +
++type v = { D }++ +
++type w = t / u / v++ +
++_ = { C } : u++ +
[black]__\_do_ : u = { C = void ;  }__ +
In the above sample code, +w+ finally stands for the type definition
+{ A } / { B } / { C } / { D }+ and expression +{ C }+ can really be coerced
into +w+ although it is initially a value of type +u+.
You may note the ++_ =++ __expr__ construct which allows evaluating the
expression __expr__ then throw its result value. Since this value is not bound
to any identifier, Opa names it ++\_do_++ in its feedback messages.

- *Tuples* +
  Tuples are generalization of pairs. A pair is a data-structure with 2
  components: a tuple has an arbitrary number of such components.
  Two tuples types are compatible if their components are compatible 2 by 2.
  This especially means that 2 compatible tuples types must at least have the
  same number of components. Syntactic sugar allows to write tuples types as
  comma-separated sequence of types enclosed between parentheses. +
  ++type t10 = (int, bool, int, int)++ defines +t10+ as a tuple with 4
    components, all being of type +int+ except the second one. +
  ++type t11('a) = ('a, 'a, 'a)++ defines  +t11+ as a tuple with 3 components
    all being of the same type, parameter of the type definition. Using
    +t11+ in a type expression with +bool+ as effective argument will hence
    represent the type of a tuple with 3 components all being booleans.

[NOTE]
Opa standard library already proposes numerous data-types like lists, maps,
sets, etc which may be directly used in developments, avoiding the need to
implement again the related common and widespread algorithms.



Typing expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In this section, we will review each Opa construct and explain which way its
type is computed. In some cases, we will see that inference is not complete and
type annotations may be added by the developper to help the typechecker in its
job.



Constant expressions
++++++++++++++++++++
Constant expressions are given their natively defined type:

- Integer values: +int+
- Boolean values (+{ true }+ and +{ false }+): +bool+
- Characters strings literals: +string+
- Signed floating point values: +float+
- The trivial type value (+{}+): +void+

Examples:

[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------------
i = 5
[black]__i : int = 5__
f = 3.14159
[black]__f : float = 3.14159__
s = "foo"
[black]__s : string = "foo"__
v = {}
[black]__v : {} / ... = void__
b = true
[black]__b : bool = { true = void ;  }__
--------------------------------------
First, notice the apparition of a construct __ident = ...__ we will detail
deeper <<identifier_binding_construct,later>>. For the intuition, let's simply
say it *binds* ("_attaches_" the result of its right-side expression to the
name __ident__). This allows to name values. Be aware that this is different
from the notion of *assignment* "à-la C" which permits to modify in place the
value stored in the memory cell touched by the assignment. The difference between
a *binding* and an *assignment* refers to the notion of mutability, i.e. the
possibility to alter the value represented by the identifier. A binding links
an identifier once for all to a value. Some kind of values are mutable, this is
the way assignments are obtained aside bindings.

Note in the above sample code that the void and boolean values have been typed
as sums, not as named types +void+ and +bool+. This is due to the fact that
type inference is structural: named types are introduced by type
annotations. Types +bool+ and +void+ are just abbreviations on the
structural types +{}+ and +{ true = void } / { false = void }+. If no explicit
type annotation imposes to see these void and boolean values as +void+ and
+bool+, the structural types induced by their structures remain the primarily
ones inferred.


[[typing_function_construct]]
Functions
+++++++++
A function may have arguments but always return a value. Hence, defining
a function requires to define its possible arguments and write its body, i.e.
the expression building the returned value. The form of a function expression
is:

[subs="quotes"]
-------------------------
__[__parameters__,__...__]__ -> __expr__
-------------------------

Parameters of the function are bound by the definition, hence are only available
in the function's body. Obviously, to typecheck the body of the
function, we will need the types of its arguments. Type schemes bound to
identifiers (function parameters or identifiers introduced by the
<<identifier_binding_construct,identifier binding construct>>) are recorded in
an internal structure we call here a "__typing environment__" acting as the
memory of "__already seen identifiers'__" types.

Typechecking a function expression is performed in 3 steps:

1. First, each parameter is given a temporary "_unknown_" type: a trivial
   type scheme (i.e. with no generalized variables) whose body is a type
   variable.
   [medium red]*This especially means that a function parameter can't be used
   polymorphically inside the body of the function.* +
2. The body __expr__ is then typechecked in the typing __environment__ extended
   by the function's parameters, hence leading to the type __τ__ of the returned
   value.
3. Finally, an "__arrow__" type is built, grouping the types of the parameters
   (that were possibly instantiated because of type constraints found while
   typechecking the function's body) on the left-side of the "__arrow__"
   and setting the returned type on the right-side, finally giving a type of
   the form __τ~1~, ..., τ~n~ -> τ__.

Examples:

[subs="quotes"]
-------------------------
_ = x -> x + 1
[black]__\_do_ : int -> int = &lt;fun&gt;__
-------------------------

First, notice the +_ = ...+ notation that allows to throw the result of the
expression laying on its right-side. This is a particular form of identifier
binding, a construct described in detail
<<identifier_binding_construct,later>>. For the moment, the intuition to keep
is that it binds the result of the expression to "_nothing_".

In this sample code, +x+ is inserted in the typing environment with a type
variable, say +'a+ (what we previously called an "_unknown_" type). The body of
the function is then typechecked. Even is we didn't present yet the typechecking
of function application, driven by the intuition, the operator + expects two
integers and returns an integer. Hence, to be correctly typed, the parameter
+x+ of the function must be of type +int+ i.e. the type variable +'a+
previously introduced for +x+ gets instantiated by +int+. Now, +1+ also has type
+int+, so the operator + is
used in a consistent typing context, returning a value of type +int+ which is
the global type of the function's body. Finally, the whole function type is
built having +'a+ now being +int+ on the left-side of the +->+ and +int+ on
its right-side, giving ++int -> int++.


[subs="quotes"]
-------------------------
_ = x, y -> x + 1
[black]__\_do_ : int, 'v0 -> int = &lt;fun&gt;__
-------------------------
This second example shows a function with 2 arguments. As previously, each of
them is entered in the typing environment with a type variable before
typechecking the body of the function. This body is the same than in the
previous example, hence it doesn't use the +y+ parameter of the function. As a
consequence, no constraint applies on +y+ and its type remains a variable. As a
final result, grouping the types of the arguments on the left-side of the +->+
and the result type on its right, we obtain the final type ++int, 'v0 -> int++.


[subs="quotes"]
-------------------------
_ = -> "constant"
[black]__\_do_ : -> string = &lt;fun&gt;__
-------------------------
In this last code snippet, since the function doesn't have any argument, its
body is typechecked in the unmodified typing environment. The string literal
++"constant"++ representing the body of the function had type +string+ which
is the type of its returned value. Since there is no argument, there is no
type to set on the left-side of the final +->+ type, only the result type will
appear on its right-side, leading to the function type ++ -> string++.


Application
+++++++++++
Application is the construct allowing to "_use_" a function by providing it
some effective arguments. In Opa, an application expression is denoted by a
functional expression on the left-side and the enumeration comma-separated and
between parentheses of the expressions being effective arguments to pass to the
function:

[subs="quotes"]
-------------------------
__expr~1~__(__[expr~2~__,__...__]__)__
-------------------------

If the function requires no argument, then the enumeration between the
parentheses is empty, however, the parentheses still remain required. Note
*that there must not be any blank between the functional expression and
the opening parenthesis*. Typechecking an application is performed in 4 steps:

1. First arguments expressions __expr~2~__, ... are typechecked, leading to as
   many types ++τ~2~, ...++.
2. Next, the functional expression __expr~1~__ is typechecked. It is then
   expected to lead to a functional type with as many arguments' types as there
   are effective arguments and returning a value of a certain type: ++τ++.
   Hence, the expected type must have the form
   ++τ'~2~, ... -> τ++.
3. Each effective argument's type ++τ~i~++ is checked against the corresponding
   ++τ'~i~++ of the type inferred for the function to ensure they are
   compatible.
4. Finally, the type of the application is the result type of the function,
   i.e. ++τ++

Examples:

[subs="quotes"]
-------------------------
f(x, y) = x + y + 1
[black]__f : int, int -> int = &lt;fun&gt;__
_ = f(2, 4)
[black]__\_do_ : int = 7__
-------------------------
To begin, simply ignore the typechecking of the function +f+, we will have
a look at it later. Simply accept it has type ++int, int -> int++ and let's
examine the second expression. The arguments expressions +2+ and +4+ have
type +int+. We then typecheck the functional expression which is the identifier
+f+. Even if we don't have described typechecking of identifiers yet, we already
introduced the notion of "_typing environment_" keeping trace of types of
identifiers (see <<typing_function_construct,Functions>>). Looking-up in this
environment we find that +f+ has type ++int, int -> int++. Hence, we see that
the types of the effective arguments provided in the application are compatible
with the expected types arguments of ++f++ (i.e. ++int++). Hence the result type
is the one on the right-side of ++f++'s type: ++int++.

To go further, we can study how +f+ is typechecked since its body contains the
application of the operator \+. Like previously described for functions, +x+ and
+y+ are entered in the typing environment both with temporary type variables,
say +'a+ and +'b+. Then the body of the function which is an application must
be typechecked. We then first type the arguments, i.e. +x+ and +y+ that have
types +'a+ and +'b+. Assuming that + has the obvious type +int, int -> int+ we
must now ensure that the types of the effective arguments are compatible with
the type of \+. This means that +'a+ must be +int+ and same thing for +'b+: the
two type variables get then instantiated, i.e. made "_equal_" to +int+. The
result
type of the application is then the result type of \+, i.e. ++int++. We iterate
exactly the same process to typecheck the addition with the constant ++1++ which
finally gives type ++int++. Hence, ++int++ is the type of ++f++'s body, so the
returned type of +f+. As a consequence, ++f++ is inferred the final type
++int, int ->int++.



[[identifier_binding_construct]]
Identifier binding
+++++++++++++++++++
The construct

[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
__ident__ = __expr~1~__
__expr_~2~__
--------------------------------
allows to evaluate __expr~1~__, bind its value to __ident__ and evaluate
__expr_~2~__ in which __ident__ possibly appears and will be replaced by its
bound value. Identifier binding introduces polymorphism in Opa: once the type
of the expression to bind to the identifier is computed, all the type
variables remaining in it with no constraint are considered polymorphic
and "_generalized_". As a consequence, in identifier binding expressions,
identifiers obtain not a type but a type scheme (see also
the presentation of <<type_variable, type variables>>) that can be
polymorphic.

Typechecking this construct processes in 3 steps:

1. First, __expr~1~__ is typechecked, leading to a type __τ~1~__.
2. Then __τ~1~__ gets generalized: all type variables without any constraint
   are generalized and universally quantified to lead to a type scheme. This
   type scheme is then bound to the identifier __ident__ in the typing
   environment.
3. Finally, __expr~2~__ is typechecked in the extended typing environment,
   giving a type __τ~2~__ which is the final type of the whole expression.

Examples:
[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------------
v =
  one = 1
  one + one
[black]__v : int = 2__
--------------------------------------
The identifier +one+ is bound to the value ++1++ which has type ++int++. Then it
is used in an addition. The operator + expects 2 integers and returns an
integer.
Hence, since ++one++ was found of type ++int++, it can safely be used with the
addition, hence this latter expression leads to the final type ++int++.

By the way, we can note a special identifier binding construct, the
toplevel one that binds the identifier ++v++. In its toplevel flavor, this
construct doesn't have any trailing expression (we previously called
__expr_~2~__). This allows to bind identifiers at the outermost level of a
program, i.e. to give it a scope (a "_life duration_") spanning on
"_all the rest of the program_".

[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------------
pair =
  identity(x) = x
  (identity(1), identity("foo"))
[black]__pair : tuple_2(int, string) = { f1 = 1 ; f2 = "foo" }__
--------------------------------------

The above code snippet introduces 2 features. First, the shortcut for defining
a function by directly enumerating its arguments. Instead of writing
+f = x, y -> 4+, it is possible to write +f(x, y) = 4+. Second, we make use of
the built-in syntactic sugar to represent tuples whose components are enclosed
between parentheses and comma-separated.

Hence, the identifier +identity+ gets bound to a function type directly
returning its argument. Clearly, such a function can take any kind of value and
will return this kind of value. The only constraint on the type of this
function is that it returns the same type it got for its argument, hence
giving the type +'a -> 'a+. This type can then be generalized giving +identity+
the polymorphic type scheme +∀ 'a.'a -> 'a+. The function is then invoked
twice, once with an +int+, once with a +string+, which is legal since it has
a polymorphic type. Hence, the results of these invocations have types +int+
and +string+ and are grouped in a tuple, ++tuple_2(int, string)++ which is the
final type of this expression.


[[recursive_identifier_binding]]
Recursive identifier binding
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Similarly to the identifier binding construct, the recursive flavor

[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
rec __ident~1~__ = __expr~1~__
...
rec __ident~n~__ = __expr~n~__
__expr_~n+1~__
--------------------------------
allows to bind each __ident~i~__ to the value of __expr~i~__ but with
all the __ident~...~__ possibly appearing in the bodies, __expr~...~__, of
the bound expressions. This hence allows (mutually) recursive
definitions. Intuitively, this implies that to compute the type to bind to
__ident~i~__, we must compute the type of all the expressions __expr~...~__
for which we may need to already known the types bound to the __ident~...~__.

Note that toplevel definitions are automatically reordered, i.e. it is possible
to use a function and define it later and if needed, definitions are implicitly
made recursive. Hence, the ++rec++ construct mostly serves to define *local*
recursive definitions, i.e. definitions not spanning at toplevel (or in other
words, definitions nested in other definitions).

Typechecking this construct processes in 5 steps:

1. First, each __ident~i~__ is temporarily given a "_unknown_" type: a trivial
   type scheme (i.e. with no generalized variables) whose body is a type
   variable.
   [medium red]*This especially means that a recursively defined identifier
   can't be used polymorphically in its own definition.* +
   The typing environment gets extended, binding each __ident~i~__ to its
   related temporary type scheme.
2. Then each __expr~i~__ is typechecked in the extended typing environment,
   leading to a type __τ~i~__.
3. Now the bodies of the bindings are typechecked, each __τ~i~__ and the
   related temporary type scheme bound to __ident~i~__ (which have
   possibly be instantiated by some type constraints) are checked to ensure
   they are compatible.
4. If so, each __τ~i~__ is then generalized and becomes the type scheme bound to
   __ident~i~__ in the typing environment.
5. Finally, __expr~n+1~__ is typechecked in the extended typing environment,
   giving a type __τ~n+1~__ which is the final type of the whole expression.



Value identifiers
+++++++++++++++++
As we previously introduced (see <<typing_function_construct, Functions>>), the
typing environment is a memory keeping trace of types inferred and bound
to identifiers (bound by a function definition or an identifier binding
construct). More accurately, it contains, not the types, but the *type schemes*
bound to identifiers since Opa supports polymorphism.

Typechecking an identifier expression aims to find a type for this identifier
and is performed in two steps.

1. First a looking-up is performed in the typing environment to find the type
   scheme entered for this identifiers. Providing that the identifier was
   actually defined, it das obviously been typechecked and bound a type scheme in
   this environment.
2. The obtained type scheme must be transformed into a type. Remember that a
   type scheme is a "_model_", a "_pattern_" of types, describing a "_family_"
   of possible types. Generalized (i.e. universally quantified) type variables
   in the scheme represent "_parts_" that can be instantiated at need by any
   type expression. In order to allow the identifier to be used with different
   types in place of the type variables of its scheme, the scheme gets
   "_specialized_", i.e. the type for this occurrence of the identifier is
   built by copying the scheme's body, replacing all generalized type variables
   by fresh (i.e. not appearing anywhere in the program) type variables.

Examples:

[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
id(x) = x
[black]__id : 'v0 -> 'v0 = &lt;fun&gt;__
one = 1
[black]__one : int = 1__
hello = "Hi"
[black]__hello : string = "Hi"__
_ = (id(one), id(hello), id(id))
[black]__\_do_ : tuple_3(int, string, 'v1 -> 'v1)__
--------------------------------

In this sample code, the interesting part deals with the 3 applications used
to build the tuple expression. We see that +id+ was entered in the typing
environment with the polymorphic type scheme +∀ 'a.'a -> 'a+.

Hence when
typechecking +id(one)+, the type scheme of +one+ is fetched, which is not
polymorphic and whose body is +int+. Hence, the occurrence of +one+ is given
the type +int+. The type scheme of +id+ is then fetched and instantiated: the
quantified type variable +'a+ is replaced by a fresh one, say +'b+ leading to
type +'b ->'b+ (note there is no more ∀ since this is a type, not a type
scheme). Application then makes this +'b+ instantiated into +int+ and leading to
the final application type +int+ for the first component of the tuple.

The
second component of the tuple is processed the same way, the type scheme of +id+
being fetched again in the environment and specialized again by replacing +'a+
by another fresh type variable, say +'c+. The type scheme of +hello+ is fetched
and  is not polymorphic, leading to type +string+. As a consequence, not
surprisingly the type of the second component of the tuple is +string+.

Finally
remains the third and last component of the tuple. The type scheme of +id+ is
fetched twice: one first time for the argument of the application, one second
time
for the functional part of it. Each occurrence of +id+ is then given a type
obtained by specialization of the scheme, each one having fresh type variables
in place of the ones generalized in +id+'s scheme, leading to types
+'d ->'d+ for the functional usage of +id+ and +'e ->'e+ for +id+ used as
argument. Then typechecking of the application imposes that +'d+ and +'e->'e+
must be the same type. The result of the application expression being +'d+,
from the constraint we have just seen, we obtain that +id(id)+ has type
+'e->'e+, which is the type of the third component of the tuple.


Records and sums
++++++++++++++++
A sum expression consists in the record representing the case of sum, i.e. an
enumeration (possibly empty) between braces and semi-separated of the
field labels with their related values that represent the sum case:

[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
{ __[label__ = __expr__ ; __...]__ }
--------------------------------

Such an expression always lead to an *opened* sum type containing a *closed*
record. The reasons for closed / opened are the following:

- Since the record enumerates all the fields of the case, this means that this
  record has no more fields in this expression. For this reason, it must be
  *closed* because it contains no other fields than thoses explicitly stated
  in the expession.
- Since the expression represents one case of sum, its type at least contains
  this case, but possibly some other cases. Hence it must be opened to accept
  being compatible with these possible future other cases.

Typechecking of a record expression is performed in 3 steps:

1. Each field expression __expr~i~__ is typechecked, leading to as many types
   __τ~i~__.
2. A closed record type is then built, binding each __label~i~__ to its
   related found type __τ~i~__. This record being closed means that it doesn't
   end by a "__row variable__", hence won't be compatible with record containing
   other fields than those explicitly specified.
3. Finally, an opened sum type is created, plugging the above record type as
  one of its case. This sum being opened means that it ends by a
  "__column variable__", hence means that the type of this expression contains
  "__at least__" this case, but may be more if needed.



Pattern-matching
++++++++++++++++
Pattern-matching is the construct allowing to discriminate by cases on the
structure of a value. According to the syntax:

[source,opa]
-------------
match expr with
 | case_1 -> expr_1
 | case_2 -> expr_2
  ...
 | case_n -> expr_n
-------------
the expression __expr__ is matched against each pattern in sequence, stopping
on the first one that matches. This fitting between the value and the pattern
may induce bindings of pattern variables. The environment is then extended by
these bindings and the right-side part expression of the matching case is then
evaluated as the result of the whole expression.

As a consequence, the matched value and all the patterns must have a same type.
Because any right-side part expression of the cases can be returned, they must
also have a same type.

More accurately, typechecking of this construct is performed as follows. First,
the matched expression is typechecked, leading to a type __τ__. Then, each
pattern is typechecked leading to types __τ~1~__, ... __τ~n~__ that are checked
to be compatible together and with __τ__. While typechecking patterns, pattern
variable types are inferred and reminded for later.
At this point, a special operation
is performed on catchall patterns ("_", or pattern variables) having a sum
type. In effect, a catchall pattern absorbs "__any other value not already
matched by previous patterns__". In the case of sum types, this means that the
column type representing this sum can have "__any other cases__", hence is
opened. For this reason, sum types appearing in the type of a catchall pattern
get recursively opened (i.e. opening is done in depth).
Now the type of the matched
expression and patterns is computed, each right-side part expression of cases
is typechecked in the environment extended by bindings of its related pattern
variables (previously recorded). As a result, each branch gets a type
__τ\'~1~__, ..., __τ'~n~__ that are checked to be compatible.
The resulting type of the whole expression is then the type of the right side
parts expressions of the pattern-matching.

Below follow some examples showing pattern-matching typechecking.
[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
f(x) =
  match x with
  | 0 -> false
  | 1 -> false
  | _ -> true
[black]__f : int -> bool =  &lt;fun&gt;__
--------------------------------

Typechecking the matched expression ++x++ doesn't impose any particular
constraint. Hence ++x++ is assigned a type variable. Then, each pattern is
typechecked and appears to be ++int++. Now, each right-side part
is typechecked leading to type ++bool++ which is the return type of the
function. The last pattern is a catchall, but since it doesn't have a sum type,
opening has no effect. Since this function takes ++x++ as parameter and this
latter was inferred the type ++int++, the final type of this function is as
expected ++int -> bool++.

[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
g1(x) =
  match x with
  | { a = 1 } -> 0
  | { b = bval } -> bval
[black]__g1 : {b : int } / {a : int} -> int = &lt;fun&gt;__
--------------------------------

Typechecking the patterns, it can be seen that the matched expression
must be of a type sum containing either ++{ a : int }++ or ++{ b : 'a }++.
At this point, the pattern variable ++bval++ is not yet constrained to any
particular type from the current context, so it remains a type variable. Hence,
the type of the matched expression must be, a priori, ++{b : 'a} / {a : int}++.
The first right side part is then typechecked leading to type ++int++. The
second one, thanks to the previously recorded binding of ++bval++ to ++'a++,
has type ++'a++ and must be compatible with ++int++. Hence ++'a++ must be
instantiated by ++int++. As a result, the matched value must have type
++{b : int } / {a : int}++ and the result of the pattern-matching must have
type ++int++. Finally, we have a catchall pattern, the variable ++bval++,
but since its type is not a sum type, opening has no effect and types are not
changed. Hence, the function ++g1++ is inferred of type
++{b : int } / {a : int} -> int++.

[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
g2(x) =
  match x with
  | { a = 1 } -> 0
  | { b = bval } -> bval
  | _ -> 42
[black]__g2 : {b : int} / {a : int} / ... -> int = &lt;fun&gt;__
--------------------------------

This example only differs from the previous one by the addition of a final
catchall case. Typechecking is done in a similar way than in the previous
example. The only difference is that because the catchall pattern is related
to a sum type (++{b : int} / {a : int}++), opening columns has now an effect.
The type of the matched value finally gets opened, under the form
++{b : int} / {a : int} / ...++ to reflect the fact that this pattern-matching
can handle sums with a case ++{ a }++, a case ++{ b }++ or any other case.

[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
g3(x) =
  match x with
  | { a = { c } } -> { d }
  | { b = bval } -> bval
[black]__g3 : {b : {d} / ...} / {a : {c}} -> {d} / ... = &lt;fun&gt;__
--------------------------------

More subtle, the above example shows that while typechecking the patterns,
the catchall pattern variable ++bval++ is not yet constrained, hence remains
a type variable ++'a++. If we have a look "in the future", we will see that
right-side parts impose that ++'a++ is instantiated by a sum type. However, this
is not yet known and the opening operation has no effect on the type
currently bound to ++bval++.
The type of right-side parts is now inferred. The first one imposes to have a
sum type containing a case ++{ d }++, hence has type ++{ d } / ...++
(remember that a record expression is by default inferred as plugged in an
opened column). The second one imposes now ++'a++ to be instantiated by the
former type. This instantiation of ++'a++ propagates both in the types of the
argument and of the result of the function ++g3++, stating that this
pattern-matching can in fact handle sums with a case ++{ a : { c } }++ and a
case ++{ b }++ itself having a sum type containing "++d++ or any other case".
This difference then appears in the global type of the function ++g3++ since
it shows that it returns a sum with either a case ++a++ or any other case
being the embedded value of its argument when it is a sum of the form
++{ b = ... }++.

[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
g4(x) =
  match x with
  | { a = 1; b = { c = 3 } } -> 0
  | { a = 1; b = { c = 4 } } -> 0
  | _ -> 0
[black]__g4 : {a : int; b : {c : int} / ... } / ... -> int = &lt;fun&gt;__
--------------------------------
This example demonstrates the opening of sums due to catchall patterns operating
in depth. In effect, the final "_" pattern is bound to a sum type
++{a : int; b : {c : int} }++, i.e. a sum whose first case has a field ++b++
also having a sum type. Since this catchall "absorbs all the other cases" of
this sum type, it absorbs others cases than ++{ a ; b }++ but recursively also
" the other cases than ++{ c }++ in the type of ++b++". For this reason, both
sum types get opened in the argument of the function (note the apparition of
the 2 column variables ++/ ...++).


++ ++ +
** Pattern-matching and records** +
By default, when typechecking patterns, if all the patterns lead to a same
record type, the inferred type is a sum type with only one case being this
record type:
[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
g5(x) =
  match x with
  | { a = 1 ; b = "" } -> x
  | { a = 2 ; b = "A" } -> x
  | _ -> x
[black]__g5 : {a : int; b : string} / ... -> {a : int; b : string} / ... = &lt;fun&gt;__
v = g5({ a = 1 ; b = "" })
[black]__v : {a : int; b : string} / ... = { a = 1 ; b = "" }__
_ = v.a
[black]__\_do_ : int = 1__
--------------------------------

Since such a sum only has one case, it remains compatible with a record as shows
the creation of ++v++ then its field access in the above sample code. However,
it is possible to add constraints enforcing the matched expression to have a
pure record type, i.e. a closed sum. For instance, in:

[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
g6(x) =
  match x with
  | { a = 1 ; b = "" } -> x.a
  | { a = 2 ; b = "A" } -> 1
  | _ -> 2
[black]__g6 : {a : int; b : string} -> int = &lt;fun&gt;__
--------------------------------
the field access performed on ++x++ in the right-side part of the first case
imposes ++x++ to be a record (see section dealing with
<<field_access, field access>>), i.e. to be plugged into a closed column.
This appears in the type of ++g6++ since is has any more column variable in
spite of the catchall pattern. In effect, opening operation is performed after
typechecking the patterns and before typechecking right-side parts. Hence, the
field access construct enforce closing again the column that was opened due to
the final catchall pattern. This is sound because if the sum was remained
opened, the following example

[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
g6bug(x) =
  match x with
  | { a = 1 ; b = "" } -> x.a
  | { a = 2 ; b = "A" } -> 1
  | _ -> x.a
--------------------------------

would also have type ++{a : int; b : string} /... -> int++ which would be
unsound because it would mean that in the default case, when none of the 2
first patterns matches the tested value, we return its field ++x++. Passing
this function a value of any form not compatible with the 2 first patterns and
not containing a field ++x++, for instance, ++{ c = 1 }++, would fall in this
default case and since no field ++a++ is present, the field access would fail.


++ ++ +
** Pattern-matching and elipsis** +
A special form of pattern, the elipsis written "..." can be used in record
patterns involved with both sums and records. However, it currently has 2
different meanings depending on the context and these 2 meanings may sometimes
conflict. Elipsis is used in patterns under the form:

[source,opa]
-------------
match x with
  | { a = 1 ; ... } ->
-------------

The first meaning of the elipsis is "this pattern is an opened record". In other
words, "this pattern matches records with at least all the specified fields,
all other ones being of no interest". For instance:

[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
h1(x) =
  match x with
  | { a = v; ... } -> v + 1
[black]__h1 : {a : int; ...} -> int = &lt;fun&gt;__
_ = h1({ a = 3 ; b = "useless"; c = 3.14159 })
[black]__\_do_ : int = 4__
--------------------------------

states that the function ++h1++ takes as argument a record having at least a
field ++a++ of type ++int++ and ignores all other possible fields of the
record actually passed.

The second meaning of the elipsis deals with sum cases in which only some fields
of each case are useful and means "this pattern matches a case of a sum
containing the specified fields that are useful and the other fields of this
case are of no interest but I don't want to enumerate all of them". For instance

[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
type t =
  { a : int ; b : int ; c : int ; d : int } /
  { e : int ; f : int }
[black]__type t = {a : int; b : int; c : int; d : int} / {e : int; f : int}__
h2(x) =
  match x : t with
  | { a = a_val ; ... } -> a_val
  | { f = f_val ; ... } -> f_val
[black]__h2 : t -> int = &lt;fun&gt;__
--------------------------------

defines a sum type with 2 cases and several fields inside. The function ++h2++
performs a pattern-matching on a value of this type but is only interested in
one of the fields of each case. To avoid the tedious enumeration of all the
other useless cases, elipsis is used to let the typechecker determine the
remaining part of the fields of each case.

However, this 2-sided aspect of the elipsis introduces tricky behavior when the
context doesn't permit to guess if the elipsis is used in the context of a
record or a sum type. Without enough information, the elipsis is implicitly
considered as meaning an opened record type. This means that this creates, for
the pattern, a record type ended by a row variable. When unifying the type of
patterns and matched expression to ensure they are compatible together, if the
opened record types of 2 patterns get unified, they will be along the record
and not along the sum. In other words, 2 opened records will join their fields
in a unique final type although 2 closed records with incompatible fields will
join into a sum type with these 2 records as cases. Hence,

[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
h3(x) =
  match x with
  | { a = 1; ... } -> 0
  | { b = 2; ... } -> 0
[black]__h3 : {a : int; b : int; ...} -> int = &lt;fun&gt;__
--------------------------------

having 2 opened cases, infers for them ++{ a : int ; ... }++ and
++{ b : int ; ... }++, that get unified into {a : int; b : int; ...},
giving this possibly surprising type to ++h3++. In fact, the point is that
there is not enough information in the context to guess if these 2 patterns
represent 2 different "interesting" fields of a record or represent 2 cases
of a sum in which we don't want to enumerate useless fields of each case.
The difference with the previous example is that in the previous one, there was
a type constraint on the matched expression bringing the information that the
matched value had a sum type. With this extra information, the typechecker
"knew" that patterns were related to a sum type and could complete the omitted
fields of each case instead of considering them as 2 records to merge together.

As we stated above, the elipsis is implicitly considered as meaning an opened
record type hence creates a type ended by a row variable. If when checking that
patterns have compatible types unification fails unifying along the record,
i.e. merging the fields of the record, then it tries to unify along the column,
i.e. creating a sum case with the 2 records as cases. Consider

[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
h4(x) =
  match x with
  | { a = 1; ... } -> 0
  | { b = "true" } -> 0
  | { a = _ } -> 0
[black]__h4 : {a : int} / {b : string} -> int = &lt;fun&gt;__
--------------------------------

the types inferred for each pattern is ++{ a : int ; ... } / ...++,
++{ b : string } / ...++ and ++{ a : int }++. Unifying the 2 first types
can't succeed along the row because the second record type is closed, then can't
acquire the field ++a++. Hence unification is performed along the column,
leading to a sum type ++{a : int; ...} / {b : string} / ...++. Now unification
is done between this type and the one of the last pattern, ++{ a : int }++.
These 2 types can be unified since ++{a : int; ... }++ and ++{ a : int }++ can
be, instantiating and closing the ending row variable. Since there is no
catchall pattern, the resulting sum is not opened, hence doesn't show any column
variable.

[CAUTION]
What happens if both row and column variables appear ? The answer is that in
this case, it may be possible to unify types along row or columns, i.e. to
merge fields of records or to catenate records as sum cases. In some cases,
there is no better choice and hence no principal type. This weakness of the
type system is known, as well as the fact that unification "prefers" (first
tries) to unify along the rows. That's some reasons why some type annotations
are sometimes required to get out of tying errors.

Let's consider the following example:

[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
h5(x) =
  match x with
  | { a = 1; ... } -> 0
  | { b = "true" } -> 0
  | _ -> 0
--------------------------------

The first pattern has type ++{ a : int ; ... } / ...++, the second one has
type ++{ b : string } / ...++ and the third has type ++'a++. When unifying
the 2 first types to ensure they are compatible, the only solution is to unify
along the columns, hence leading to a sum type:
++{ a: int ; ... } / { b : string } / ...++. Unification with the last type
only instantiates ++'a++. Because there is a catchall pattern, all sum types
remain opened, hence the global type of the patterns is finally
++{ a: int ; ... } / { b : string } / ...++. We are exactly in presence of a
type that can be unified either along its column or row variable, hence in
presence of possibilities of non-existence of principal type. In such a case,
an error is raised by the typechecker:
[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
[black]__Sum type with row and column variables
[red]##{ b: string } / { a: int; 'r.a } / 'c.a##
**Error**
Exportation failure__
--------------------------------

It is worthy to note that at this point, the typechecker detected an issue
while working with a richer type algebra that the one available to state
the signatures. In effect, this algebra temporarily tolerates sums with
row and column variables but is only internally used by the typechecker.
Error messages related to the internal type algebra print types a bit
differently.


[CAUTION]
Because a sum type represents an enumeration of cases, possibly opened, but
with each case having a fixed and finite set of fields, sums with cases
containing row variables are also not legal types. For this reason, even if
the richer and internal type algebra used by the typechecker temporarily
tolerates such types, once typecheking ends such types, if they escape are
rejected and don't fit the public type algebra in which signatures of the
values are stated. Hence, the following example:
[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
h6(x) =
  match x with
  | { a = 1; ... } -> 0
  | { b = "true" } -> 0
[black]__Closed sum type with row variable(s) [red]##{ b: string } / { a: int; 'r.a }##
**Error**
Exportation failure__
--------------------------------
is rejected since the first pattern has type ++{ a : int ; ... } / ...++. The
second one has type ++{ b : string } / ...++. Hence, unifying these 2 types
gives ++{ a : int ; ... } / { b : string } / ...++. Since there is no catchall
pattern, the sum doesn't remain opened hence leading to type
++{ a : int ; ... } / { b : string }++. This type is a sum and it actually has
a case being a row ended by a variable.


Binary conditional
++++++++++++++++++
Binary conditional is introduced under the form:

[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
if __expr~1~__ then __expr~2~__ else __expr~3~__
--------------------------------

where __expr~1~__ is the tested condition, expected to be of type ++bool++,
__expr~2~__ is the result value in case the condition holds (i.e. the
evaluation of __expr~1~__ yields ++true++) and __expr~3~__ is the result
value in case the condition doesn't holds. Since this construct can return
the value of either __expr~2~__ or __expr~3~__, both expressions must have
the same type.
Hence, typechecking of this construct if performed in 3 steps:

1. The condition expression __expr~1~__ is typechecked and it is checked to be
   of type +bool+.
2. The expression __expr~2~__ and __expr~3~__ are typechecked, leading to types
   __τ~2~__ and __τ~3~__.
3. Types __τ~2~__ and __τ~3~__ are checked to be compatible, i.e. are unified
   in a common type __τ__ and if so, the type of the whole expression is
   then __τ__.

Example:
[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
ok = if true then 1 else 2
[black]__ok : int = 1__
reok = if 1 != 2 then { A } else { B }
[black]__reok : {A : {}} / {B : {}} / ... = { A = void }__
ko = if 1 then { A } else { B }
[black]__**Error**
Matched expression or previous patterns have type [red]##int## but new pattern is
found of type [red]##{ true } / 'c.a##.__
reko = if false then 1 else "one"
[black]__**Error**
Previous right-side parts of the pattern matching return type [red]##int## but current
one returns type [red]##string##.
Types [red]##int## and [red]##string## are not compatible__
test(c, default) = if c then "Holds" else default
[black]__test : bool, string -> string = &lt;fun&gt;__
--------------------------------

In the first example, the condition expression ++true++ is correctly of type
++bool++, then both +1+ and +2+ have type +int+ hence the whole expression is
well-typed and of type ++int++.

In the second example, assuming that the comparison operator "different"
++!=++ has type ++'a -> 'a -> bool++, its application to 2 integers is
well-typed and of type ++bool++. Hence the condition expression is well-typed.
The "then" part has type ++{ A } / ...++, the "else "part has type
++{ B } / ...++, hence the common type obtained by unification of these 2
types is ++{ A } / { B } / ...++ which is the type of the whole expression.

The third example shows that because the condition expression ++1++ has type
++int++ and not ++bool++ the whole expression is ill-typed.

The next example shows that because both branches of the binary conditional do
not have the same type (++string++ versus ++int++), even if the condition
expression is of the correct type ++bool++, the whole expression is ill-typed.

Finally, the last example exhibits the constraints imposed by the binary
conditional construct, making them appearing in the type of the function using
it. In effect, since the tested condition is the first parameter, ++c++ of the
function ++test++, this enforce this parameter to be of type ++int++. Moreover,
since the "then" branch has type ++string++ and since both branches are assumed
to have the same type, the "else" part must also have type ++string++, which
requires ++default++, the second parameter of ++test++ to be of type
++string++, which is also the type of the whole conditional expression. From
these constraints, we actually find that ++test++ has type
++bool, string -> string++.

[NOTE]
Internally, the binary conditional construct is transformed in a
pattern-matching on boolean values. In other words,
++if c then t else e++ is rewritten as
++match c with { true } -> t | { false } -> e++. That's the reason why, in case
of typechecking error on a binary conditional, one sometimes get a message
involving pattern-matching as we could see in some above examples.


Modules
+++++++
Opa provides a "light" notion of modules through a special form of records
that are written between double-braces instead of simple-braces. Hence, a
module expression has the form:

[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
{{ __[label__ = __expr__ ; __...]__ }}
--------------------------------

The main feature brought by modules compared to records is the ability to have
each field separately generalized and all of them implicitly mutually recursive.
Hence, a module can be seen as a record grouping several definitions instead of
leaving them spanning at toplevel.

Since modules are a sort of records they are first-class values, i.e. can be
passed to functions, returned as result, stored in data-structures, etc.
However their type is not a simple record type. In effect, since each field,
i.e. definition of the module can be generalized, the type of the definitions
are especially processed before being part of the module type: if they are
polymorphic then their type is turned into a type-forall
(see <<type_forall_expl, types forall>>) to mimic a type scheme.
The final type of a module is them a *closed* record type in which labels are
bound to their respective type (possibly being type-forall), embedded in a
*closed* sum (i.e. the sum has the record as unique "__case__").

Typechecking of a module is performed in 4 steps:

1. Like for record expressions, each field expression __expr~i~__ is
   typechecked and like for a recursive identifier binding (see
   <<recursive_identifier_binding, dedicated section>>), fields are considered
   as implicitly mutually recursive. As a result, we obtain as many types
   __τ~i~__.
2. Each type __τ~i~__ is inspected, any unconstrained type variables get
   generalized and a type-forall __τ'~i~__ is built quantifying these
   variables and whose body it __τ~i~__. The related module field is
   then assigned this new type __τ~i~__. However if no such type variable
   exist in __τ~i~__, then no change is done and the module field keeps its
   initial type __τ~i~__.
3. A closed record type is then built, binding each __label~i~__ to its
   related found type.
4. Finally, an closed sum type is created, plugging the above record type as
   its unique "__case__".

Examples:
[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
M = {{
  plus(x, y) = x + y ;
  f(x) = x
}}
[black]__M : { f : forall('v0). 'v0 -> 'v0; plus : int, int -> int} / ... = { f = &lt;fun&gt; ; plus = &lt;fun&gt; }__
--------------------------------

As we stated before, the type of a module is a closed record in a closed sum.
The reason for having a closed record is that, like any record, a module
expression enumerates all the fields this module has, and it has no more fields
that those making its definition. There are 2 reasons for having a closed
column. First, modules are not sum types: they do not present "different cases".
Next, having an ending column variable would make it unconstrained, hence
generalized. In such a case, when creatign sub-modules, the type of the
sub-module would have a generalizable column variable and would naturally
turn itself into a type-forall which is not the expected type for a module.

This feature, pretty related to rank 2 polymorphism, however introduces some
usage restrictions. The first important point is that modules are explicitly
introduced: when the syntactic construct ++{{ }}++ is used, a module is to be
created. The second point to remind is that instantiation of type-forall is
automatic: each time an expression is found having a type-forall, it is
immediately specialized, replacing its generalized variables by fresh ones and
removing the forall quantification (i.e. the obtained type is an instance of the
type-forall's body).

Let's examine a simple example.
[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
// Definition of a module type.
type Mty = {{ f : 'a -> 'a ; g : int -> int }}
[black]__type Mty = {f : forall('a). 'a -> 'a ; g : int -> int}__

// Coercion to a module type
M = {{ f(x) = x ; g(x) = x + 1 }} : Mty
[black]__M : Mty = { f = &lt;fun&gt; ; g = &lt;fun&gt; }__
_ = M.f(5)
[black]__\_do_ : int = 5__
_ = M.f("foo")
[black]__\_do_ : string = "foo"__
--------------------------------
The first type definition introduces a module type, automatically adding the
forall-types on polymorphic fields. This avoid having to explicitly state them
in the type de finition. Next a module +M+ is defined and its signature gets
constrained by +Mty+. Note that this constraint is not mandatory but set here
to show how to constrain a module and to avoid getting a verbose structural
type like
+{f : forall('a). 'a -> 'a; g : int -> int} = { f = <fun> ; g = <fun> ;  }+
we would get otherwise. Module fields access is performed like for record, via
the dot-notation. The point to note is that +M.f+ is a forall-type, hence during
the application to the expression +5+, +M.f+ appears to have type
+forall('a). 'a -> 'a+. As stated above, this forall-type get automatically
instantiated into a fresh type +'b -> 'b+, and the type of the whole expression
is +int+ as expected. Following this point, when applied a second time, to the
expression +"foo"+, this type is instantiated again into another fresh type
+'c -> 'c+, hence preserving the polymorphism and allowing to apply +M.f+ to
a string, returning the expected +string+ final type.

An important remark is that module types are strict and there is no implicit
instantiation of explicit quantification. Automatic instantiation is only done
when encountering a forall-type as a type, not as a subterm-of a type. Hence,
coercion cannot be used to restrict the type of a module:

[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
// Rejected.
_ = {{ f(x) = x ; g(x) = x + 1 }} : {{ f : int -> int ; g : int -> int }}
[black]__**Error**

--------------------------------

Modules can be returned as results of functions, hence providing the mean to
create functors. For instance:
[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
type Mty2 = {{ f : 'a -> 'a }}
[black]__type Mty2 = {f : forall('a). 'a -> 'a}__
M2 = {{ f(x) = x }} : Mty2
[black]__M2 : Mty2 = { f = &lt;fun&gt; }__

// A functor.
F(m : Mty2) = {{
  a(x) = m.f(x)
  b(x, y) = {

    f2 = m.f(x)

    f4 = m.f(y)
  }
}}

--------------------------------

However, an important consequence of module types strictness is that a module
cannot be passed to a function expecting a less general module or a record,
for instance:

[subs="quotes"]

f(m) = {{
  a(x) = {
    f1 = m.f(x) ;
    f2 = m.f(365)

--------------------------------


[[field_access]]
Field access ("dot" access)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This construct allows to access the value of a record field following the
form __expr__++.++__field name__. As a consequence, it is expected that
__expr__ has a record type in which the field __field name__ exists with a
given type __τ__. The type of the whole expression is then this type __τ__.

[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
type t('a) = { a : 'a }
[black]__type t('a) = { a : 'a }__
x = { a = 3.14159 } : t(float)
[black]__x : t(float) = { a = 3.14159 }__
_ = x.a
[black]__\_do_ : float = 3.14159__
_ = x.b
[black]__**Error**
Record has type [red]##t(float)## but field access expected it to have type
[red]##{ b: 'a; 'r.a }##.__
--------------------------------

As shows the last example, if the "dotted" expression doesn't have a record
type containing at least the required field, the expression is ill-typed. It
is important to note that the expected record type must contain at least the
accessed fields and may contain any other ones as the ending row variable
++'r.a++ suggests.



[[record_update]]
Record update
+++++++++++++
The construct:
[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
{ __expr~0~__ with __field~1~ = __expr~1~__ ; ... ; __field~n~ = __expr~n~__ }
--------------------------------
allows creating a new record value, borrowing all the fields from
__expr~0~__ but replacing the values of __field~1~__ to __field~n~__ by
those evaluated for __expr~1~__ to __expr~n~__.
Three important points are:

- The fields updated must belong to the type of __expr~0~__. This means that
  record update doesn't add new fields to the record. This restriction is
  required to keep Opa's type system consistent.
- The types of the updated fields can however change from the ones they had
  in __expr~0~__.
- This construct only applies on records, i.e. opened or closed rows hosted by
  a closed column.

Let's assume that __expr~0~__ has a record type with fields __field~1~__ to
__field~n~__ and other possible fields __fields~m~__ of type __τ~ms~__.
Expressions __expr~1~__, to __expr~n~__ are typechecked leading to types
__τ~1~__, ..., __τ~n~__. The type of the whole expression is then the record
type where __field~1~__ is bound to type __τ~1~__, ..., __field~n~__ bound
to type __τ~n~__ and all other fields from the type of __expr~0~__ are
unchanged. In particular, if the original record type was opened (resp.
closed), so will be the resulting one. This is clearly shown by the type of the
function ++f++ in the example below where both the argument and return types
are opened records since the body of this function only add the constraint
that the record must contain at least the field ++x++.

[subs="quotes"]

--------------------------------


Type coercion
++++++++++++++
Although Opa proposes type inference, it is sometimes useful to force an
expression to have a certain type instead of the one naturally guessed by
the typechecker. This mostly happen when a particular signature is wanted for
an expression (for instance for sake of abstraction) or when a type was
structurally inferred although the user prefers to get a named type having the
same structure (either for sake of shortness or because the type structurally
inferred is recursive and hence must be explicitly replaced by a named type
since cyclic types are not accepted in types appearing in values interfaces).

Type coercion, __expr__++:++__t__, typechecks __expr__ leading to a type
__τ__. Then is converts the type expression __t__ leading to a second type
__τ'__. Finally, if __τ__ and __τ'__ are compatible, it gives the whole
expression the type __τ'__.

[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
type t = int
[black]__type t = int__
_ = 4 : t
[black]__\_do_ : t = 4__
_ = 4.5 : t
[black]__**Error**
Description: This expression has type [red]##float##.

rec f(x, y) : ilst = if x then { nil } else { head = y ; tail = f(true, y) }
[black]__f : bool, int -> ilst = &lt;fun&gt;__
--------------------------------

The first coercion in the above sample code show that because ++t++ and ++int++
are compatible, the value ++4++ being naturally of type ++int++ can be assigned
the type ++t++. The second example shows that because ++4.5++ has type ++float++
and this latter and ++int++ are not compatible, coercion is a failure.
Finally, the last example exhibits a case where an explicit naming of a
recursive type must be done. First, a type similar to a list of integer is
defined, ++ilst++. Then the function ++f++ that builds empty or one-length
lists of integer is defined. Since Opa typechecking is performed in a
structural way, nothing in the body of ++f++ indicates that it works on a
particular named type. The constraints only indicates that the function returns
a record type containing a field ++tail++ having this record type. As a result,
an error is issued since cyclic types must not escape in signatures.
Adding a coercion on the return type of ++f++, like in the last line of code,
allows the typechecker to find a named type hiding the recursion and removes
the error.

++ ++ +
**Implicit type parameters in coercions** +
When using a parameterized type name in a coercion, it is possible to
omit the arguments by which its parameters must be instantiated. The
typechecker will then automatically instantiate them according to the context.
Omission applies to all or none of the parameters: only omitting some of them
will result in a typechecking error related to the arity of the used type
name. To omit only some of the arguments, they must explicitly be replaced
by some underscore ("_") characters upon matching the right arity of the
type constructor.


[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------

[black]__\_do_ : t(int, string) = { first = 1 ; second = "str" }__
_ : t(int) = { first = 1 ; second = "str" }
[black]__**Error**
Description: The type instanciation for [red]##t## is invalid. According to the

_ : t(int, \_) = { first = 1 ; second = "str" }
[black]__\_do_ : t(int, string) = { first = 1 ; second = "str" }__
--------------------------------

In the above sample code, a record type, ++t++, with 2 parameters is defined.
The first coercion omits all of them. According to the context, since field
++first++ is assigned the value ++1++ and field the value ++"str"++ it is
inferred that ++'a++ maps onto ++int++ and ++'b++ onto ++string++. The second
coercion only omits 1 of the parameters but doesn't explicitly state the
omission, hence making the type ++t++ used with a wrong number of argument.
Finally, the last example explicitly claims that the first parameter of ++t++ is
expected to be ++int++ but second one is not explicitly given, hence
making the ++t++ type constructor used with its right number of arguments and
avoiding the previous error.


++ ++ +
**Type variables in coercions and generalization** +
Type variables appearing in coercion type expressions have precise scoping
rules and may influence the generalization process, i.e. the polymorphism
level of definitions. Mostly, in type annotations, type variables are identified
by their name. This means that inside a definition, several occurrences of a
same type variable name implies the sharing of this type variable among these
occurrences. The scope of a type variable name is:

- the current toplevel value definition,
- the current module field definition.

In other words, all along these 2 constructs, a same variable name represents
a unique type variable. For instance, in:
[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
f(x, y) = y : 'a
[black]__f : 'v0, 'a -> 'a = &lt;fun&gt;__
g(x:'a, y) = y : 'a
[black]__g : 'a, 'a -> 'a = &lt;fun&gt;__
--------------------------------
the definition of ++f++ introduces a type variable ++'a++ used only once.
As a result, ++x++ and ++y++ have 2 different types since they are not
related. Conversely, in ++g++, a new type variable ++'a++ is introduced
(diferent from the one of ++f++), but used twice, once to constrain ++x++ and
once to constrain ++y++. Since these 2 occurrences of ++'a++ are hosted in the
same toplevel definition, they represent the same variable. As a result, the
types of the 2 arguments of ++g++ are enforced to be the same which was not the
case in ++f++.

This example can be reproduced the same way in a module since the scope of a
variable introduced in a module field is this module field:
[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
M = {{
  f(x, y) = y : 'a
  g(x:'a, y) = y : 'a
}}
[black]__M : {
  f : forall('v0, 'a). 'v0, 'a -> 'a ;
  g : forall('a). 'a, 'a -> 'a } =
 { f = &lt;fun&gt; ; g = &lt;fun&gt; }__
--------------------------------
As the type-forall's suggest variables are differents (i.e. not shared) between
the fields ++f++ and ++g++ since they are generalized separatly. And like in the
previous example, ++f++ has 2 arguments with different types although ++g++ have
its ones of the same type.

[CAUTION]
Introducing type variables in coercions **doesn't** mean that the annotated
expression is polymorphic ! This only means that its type is named by this
type variable. Generalization, i.e. polymorphism introduction is a separate
process that arises at the end of a definition. In particular, introducing a
type variable in a annotation will postpone its possible generalization upon the
end of the current toplevel or module field definition. In effect, as soon as
a name is introduced for a type, we can't make sure this name will be or not
used later, until we get out of the definition where it is introduced. For
this reason, it is not safe to generalize it as soon as we leave the definition
where it appears since some later type constraints may change this variable
into a non-variable type, i.e. the variable will not remain a variable hence
can't be subject to generalization. Let's consider:
[subs="quotes"]
--------------------------------
f1() =
  rec v1(x : 'a) : 'b = v1(x)
  v1
[black]__f1 :  -> ('a -> 'b) =  &lt;fun&gt;__
f2() =
  rec v1(x : 'a) : 'b = v1(x)
  _ = v1(1)
  _ = v1(1.0)
  v1
[black]__**Error**
Function was found of type [red]##int -> 'a## but application expects it to be of type
[red]##float -> 'b##.
Types [red]##int## and [red]##float## are not compatible__
f3() =
  rec v1(x : 'a) : 'b = v1(x)
  v2 : bool -> int = v1
  v1
[black]__f3 :  -> (bool -> int) =  &lt;fun&gt;__
--------------------------------
Let's first have a look at ++f1++. It introduces 2 variables, ++'a++ and
++'b++ that finally get generalized in the final type of ++f1++ that really
is polymorphic. However, it must be clear that these 2 type variables were
**not** generalized at the end of the local definition of ++v1++ ! They were
generalized at the end of the toplevel definition of ++f1++ through the
generalization of the type of ++f1++. In other words, inside the body of
++f1++, the type of ++v1++ was not polymorphic because of the presence of the
type variables. If we used ++v1++ with several types in the body of ++f1++,
we would get a typing error like it is the case in ++f2++.
The definition of ++f3++ also shows that ++'a++ and ++'b++ are not generalized
as soon as exiting from the definition of ++v1++. In effect, before returning
++v1++ as the result of ++f3++, we define a local variable ++v2++ as being equal
to ++v1++ but coercing its type. This implies a unification between the type
of ++v2++ which is forced to be ++bool -> int++ and an instance of the type
scheme of ++v1++. But, because ++v1++ is not yet generalized, its type scheme
is "trivial", i.e. has no generic variables. Hence, taking an instance of it
implies directly sharing its scheme's body, then instantiating its non-generic
variables during the unification with the type of ++v2++. For this reason,
++'a++ becomes ++bool++ and ++'b++ becomes ++int++, hence leading ++f3++ to
finally have type ++-> (bool -> int)++.


Database path
+++++++++++++
Since databases are explicitly typed at their definition, accesses to paths
simply have the type they were given when the database was defined. For
instance, defining a database as:
[source,opa]
------------------------
db /test/i : int
db /test/map : map(int, string)
------------------------
will explicitly state that the path ++ /test/i++ has type ++int++ and the
path ++ /test/map++ has type ++map(int, string)++. This way, paths can only
by used in contexts where their types are compatible with expected ones.



[[opensums_directive]]
@opensums directive
+++++++++++++++++++
Sum type definitions always lead to closed columns. In effect, such a
definition enumerates all the values of the type, hence there is no reason
for having a trailing column variable. In some particular cases, when an
expression has a type coming from such a definition, it may be useful to alter
its type to make it an anonymous opened sum in order to "plug" it in a larger
sum type. Let's consider the following example:

[subs="quotes"]
------------
type small = { a } / { b } / { c }
[black]__type small = {a} / {b} / {c}__
type larger = small / { d }
[black]__type larger = small / {d}__
larger_to_string(x : larger) =
  match x with
  | { a } -> "a"
  | { b } -> "b"
  | { c } -> "c"
  | { d } -> "d"
[black]__larger_to_string : larger -> string = &lt;fun&gt;__
small_v = { a } : small
[black]__small_v : small = { a = void }__
_ = larger_to_string(small_v)
[black]__**Error**
Function was found of type [red]##larger -> string## but application expects it to be
of type [red]##small -> 'a##.
Types [red]##{ a } / { b } / { c } / { d }## and [red]##{ a } / { b } / { c }## are not
compatible
Hint:
  One of the sum types may be missing the following cases of the other:
  [red]##{ d }##.__
------------
In the above example, the type ++larger++ clearly contains all the values of
the type ++small++, and even more. The function ++larger_to_string++ operates
on all these values, hence is also able to operate on the type ++small++.
However, applying it to a value of type ++small++ fails. The reason is that
the type ++small++ is a closed sum. Hence it can't unify with ++larger++ since
it has no column variable to acquire the field ++c++.
To workaround this issue, the ++@opensums++ directive can be applied on the
expression ++small_v++ in order to replace its type ++small++ by the structure
of this type in which all columns are turned opened (i.e. ending by a column
variable).

[subs="quotes"]
------------
_ = larger_to_string(@opensums(small_v))
[black]__\_do_ : string = "a"__
------------

This directive only has an effect when applied to an expression having a sum
type. Applying it to another type will not change the type unless it is a
type variable. In effect, type constraints are discovered in an arbitrary
order by the typechecker. At some point, it may arise that the type of an
expression is not yet complete, hence still remain a type variable even if
later it will appear to be a sum type. If the directive is applied to such an
expression, it can't yet have any effect although if the type constraints
were acquired sooner it would have an effect. When later the type variable
may get instantiated by a sum type, it will be too late to open it since the
directive expression will have been already processed. To prevent such
non-commutative behavior, an error message is issued requesting to add a type
constraint on the expression in order to be able to have its type before
applying the directive.

[subs="quotes"]
------------
f(x) = @opensums(x)
[black]__**Error**
Expression argument of the @opensums directive has a type that can't be subtype of another
type (sum or record).
Hint:
  Its type is currently unconstrained. Consider explicitly adding a type constraint toward
a sum type to precise the expression's type.__
------------

It is important to note that this directive recursively (i.e. searching in
depth) opens all the sums present in the type of its argument, except on
function types where it only descends on the result type and not on the
arguments types. In particular, named types are examined and their structure
is also recursively traversed by the opening operation. It is worthy to make
clear that because opening a sum type changes its nature, if an expression
appears to have a named type being a sum, once opened, it won't have anymore
this named type, but instead, the structure of this named type in which sums
are now opened.


[[openrecord_directive]]
@openrecord directive
+++++++++++++++++++++
As presented in the section dedicated to the <<record_update, record update>>
construct, fields borrowed from a record must exist in this record: it is
forbidden to add a new field. This restriction is imposed for sake of
consistency of Opa's type system.
However, when 2 different record types have numerous fields in common, writing
a function transforming a value of the first type to a value of the second
one, we would like not to have to "__manually__" map the common fields' values
2 by 2 between the 2 records. For instance:

[source,opa]
------------
type house = { number : int ; street : string ; city : string ; zip : int }
type rented_house = { number : int ; street : string ; city : string ;
  zip : int ; start_date : int ; end_date : int }
------------
defines 2 types, the first one describing houses in general and the second
one describing houses being rented. The only difference is that the latter
has 2 more fields than the first one. When modelling the fact that a house
gets rented, we would like to write a function like:

[source,opa]
------------
rent(h : house, start_day, stop_day) : rented_house =
 { h with start_date = start_day ; end_date = stop_day }
------------

However, above restriction forbids the addition of new fields as reported by
the error message:

[subs="quotes"]
------------
[black]__**Error**
Record to update has type [red]##house## but extension requires it to have type
[red]##{ end_date: 'a; 'r.a }##.
Types [red]##{ end_date: 'a; 'r.a }## and
[red]##{ city: string; number: int; street: string; zip: int }[red]## are not compatible
Hint:
  Field(s) [red]##end_date## only appear(s) in the first type.
Hint:
  Field(s) [red]##city## [red]##number## [red]##street## [red]##zip## only appear(s) in the second type.__
------------

One solution would then be to write this function under the form:
[source,opa]
------------
rent(h : house, start_day, stop_day) : rented_house =
  { number = h.number ; street = h.street ; city = h.city ; zip = h.zip ;
    start_date = start_day ; end_date = stop_day }
------------
which is very tedious when the number of common fields is important. As an
alternative it is possible to explicitly request a record type to get opened,
hence adding it a fresh row variable to accept addition of new fields by
the directive ++@openrecord++. The renting function can then be written as:
[source,opa]
------------
rent(h : house, start_day, stop_day) : rented_house =
 { @openrecord(h) with start_date = start_day ; end_date = stop_day }
------------
and finally gets the expected type: ++house, int, int -> rented_house++.
The ++@openrecord++ directive can only be applied on an expression
having a record type. Applying it to another type will raise an error depending
on the encountered type.

First, when the type is a variable, for the same kind of reason than explained
about the <<opensums_directive, @opensums directive>>, it is requested to
add a type constraint to explicitly precise the type as shown in the following
example:

[subs="quotes"]
------------
f(x) = @openrecord(x)
[black]__**Error**
Expression argument of the @openrecord directive has a type that can't be subtype of
another type (record).
Hint:
  Its type is currently unconstrained. Consider explicitly adding a type constraint
toward a record type to precise the expression's type.__
------------

Second, for any other type not being a record or a variable the default error
message is issued without any hint:

[subs="quotes"]
------------
_ = @openrecord(1.0)
[black]__**Error**
Expression argument of the @openrecord directive has a type that can't be subtype of a record type.__
------------

It is important to note that, conversely to the ++@opensums++ directive,
++@openrecord++ doesn't recursively traverse types: it only acts on the
toplevel structure of the type being expected, as previously explained, a
record type.


Dealing with recursive types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By default, Opa typechecker infers types in a structural way. This means that,
without user coercions, it determines the types by guessing their structure
rather by giving them names. This is pretty satisfactory since several named
types can have a same structure and there is no reason the typechecker decides
itself to give a name a priori to a type structure.
For instance, consider:

[subs="quotes"]
------------
type t = { a } / { b } / { c }
[black]__type t = { a } / { b } / { c }__
type u = { a } / { z } / { c }
[black]__type u = { a } / { z } / { c }__
f(x) =
  match x with
  | { a } -> "a"
  | { c } -> "c"
  | _ -> "something else"
[black]__f : {c} / {a} / ... -> string = &lt;fun&gt;__
------------
the function ++f++ has no reason to be considered as taking an argument of type
++t++ more than of type ++u++. The typechecker inferred a structural type,
i.e. the shape of the type.
If we want ++f++ to take explicitly a particular named type, it must be
coerced by ++f(x : t)++ or ++f(x : u)++. The fact that types are inferred
structurally is powerful since ++f++ can naturally be used with a value of
type ++t++ or ++u++ since both of them have a compatible structure:

[subs="quotes"]
------------
_ = f({ a } : t)
[black]__\_do_ : string = "a"__
_ = f({ c } : u)
[black]__\_do_ : string = "c"__
------------

However, this also has drawbacks. During type inference, the typechecker knows
how to deal with, i.e. build if required, cyclic (recursive) types. However
such types can't escape in values signatures. They must get mapped onto a
named type, whose definition is obviously recursive, who hides the structural
recursion. This may require the user to add some type annotations, i.e
coercions, to prevent these recursive types from remaining in the final
signature of the definition which leads to an error message.

[subs="quotes"]
------------
rec len(l) =
  match l with
  | { end } -> 0
  | { head = _ ; tail = t } -> 1 + len(t)
__Cyclic type [red]##'a
  where 'a = { head: 'b; tail: 'a } / { end }##
**Error**
Exportation failure__
------------

In the above example, the system determined that ++len++ is a function taking
a sum type with 2 cases, the second one containing a field, ++tail++ being
of this sum type. Hence, the type is really cyclic as reported in the error
message. To avoid such a recursive type, one must define a named type having
an equivalent structure:
[source,opa]
------------
type mylst('a) = { end } / { head : 'a ; tail : mylst('a) }
------------
allowing to "name" the recursion. From now, adding a type annotation in the
source of ++len++ will give the typechecker a clue "which type is used here"
and will allow replacing the cyclic parts of the structure by the type name.

[subs="quotes"]
------------
rec len(l : mylst('a)) =
  match l with
  | { end } -> 0
  | { head = _ ; tail = t } -> 1 + len(t)
[black]__len : mylst('a) -> int = &lt;fun&gt;__
------------
It could have been possible to put the type constraint at some other
points, like:
[source,opa]
------------
rec len(l) =
  match l with
  | { end } : mylst('a) -> 0
  | { head = _ ; tail = t } -> 1 + len(t)

rec len(l) =
  match l with
  | { end } -> 0
  | { head = _ ; tail = t : mylst('a) } -> 1 + len(t)

rec len(l) =
  match l with
  | { end } -> 0
  | { head = _ ; tail = t } -> 1 + len(t : mylst('a))
------------
but a good practice is to put constraints directly in the function's header,
the closest to its parameters and return types definition. Hence, the fully
annotated definition of ++len++ according to this good practice would be:

[source,opa]
------------
rec len(l : mylst('a)) : int =
  match l with
  | { end } -> 0
  | { head = _ ; tail = t } -> 1 + len(t)
------------
where the return type is stated after the parameters of the function and before
its body.
