In this chapter, we recapitulate the web-specific constructions of the Opa language,
including management of XML and XHTML, CSS, but also client-server security.

Syntax extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

//Since Opa is meant for web development, there are some syntactic constructs that are meant for this purpose,
//and so have not been introduced in the core language.

The syntax of expression is extended by the following rules:
[source,grammar]
--------------------------------------
expr ::=
| <xhtml>
| <ip>
| <id>
| css <css>
| css { <style-expr> }
| <action-list>
| <xml-parser>

action-list ::=
| [ <action>* sep , ]

action ::=
| <action-selector> <action-verb> <expr>

action-selector ::=
| <action-selector-head> <action-selector-property>?

action-selector-head ::=
| . <ident>
| . { <expr> }
| <id>

action-selector-property ::=
| -> <ident>
| -> { <expr> }

ip ::=
| <byte> . <byte> . <byte> . <byte>

id ::=
| # <ident>
| # { <expr> }

xhtml ::=
| <> <xhtml-content>* </>
| < <xhtml-tag> <xhtml-attribute>* />
| < <xhtml-tag> <xhtml-attribute>* > <xhtml-content>* </ <xhtml-tag>? >

xhtml-content ::=
| <xhtml>
| <xhtml-text>
| { <expr> }

xhtml-tag ::=
| <xhtml-name> : <xhtml-name>
| <xhtml-name>

xhtml-attribute ::=
| style = <xhtml-style>
| class = <xhtml-class>
| on{click,hover,...} =
| options:on{click,hover,...} =
| <xhtml-tag> = <xhtml-attr-value>

xhtml-attr-value ::=
| <string-literal>
| <single-quote-string-literal>
| { <expr> }
| <id>

xhtml-style ::=
| " <style-expr> "
| { <expr> }

xhtml-class ::=
| ' <xhtml-name>* '
| " <xhtml-name>* "
| <xhtml-name>
| { <expr> }

style-expr ::=
| ...

css ::=
| ...

xml-parser ::=
| xml_parser <xml-parser-rules>

xml-parser-rules ::=
| |? <xml-parser-rule>* sep | end?

xml-parser-rule ::=
| <xml-named-pattern>+ -> <expr>

xml-named-pattern ::=
| <ident> <xml-parser-suffix>?
| <ident> = <xml-pattern> <xml-parser-suffix>?
| parser? <parser-prod>+

xml-pattern ::=
| < <xhtml-tag> <xml-pattern-attribute>* />
| < <xhtml-tag> <xml-pattern-attribute>* > <xml-named-pattern>* </ <xhtml-tag> >
| _
| { <expr> }
| ( <xml-parser-rules> )

xml-pattern-attribute ::=
| <xhtml-tag> <xml-pattern-attribute-rhs>?

xml-pattern-attribute-rhs ::=
| <xml-pattern-attribute-value>
| ( <xml-pattern-attribute-value> as <ident> )

xml-pattern-attribute-value ::=
| <string-literal>
| { <expr> }
| _

xml-parser-suffix ::=
| ?
| +
| *
| { <expr> }
| { <expr> , <expr> }
--------------------------------------

Additionaly, some more directives are available.

And finally, the identifiers +server+ and +css+ have a special role at toplevel.

Xhtml, xml
^^^^^^^^^^
Although xhtml and xml is not a built-in datastructure, there is a shorthand syntax for building it.
[source,opa]
--------------------------------------
div = <div class="something">Hey</div>
--------------------------------------

which is a shorthand for the following structure:

[source,opa]
--------------------------------------
{ namespace =  Xhtml.ns_uri
  tag = "div"
  args = []
  specific_attributes = {
    some = {
      class = ["something"] ;
      style = [] ;
      events = [] ;
      events_options = [] ;
      href = {none}
    }
  }
  content = [{ text = "Hey" }]
} : xhtml
--------------------------------------

The syntax only allows to build xhtml (not html, so there is no implicit closing of tags).
On the other end, it is allowed to close any tag with the empty tag:
[source,opa]
--------------------------------------
div = <div class="something">Hey</>
--------------------------------------

You can build fragments of xhtml with an empty tag:
[source,opa]
--------------------------------------
<> First piece <div class="something">Hey</div> Third piece </>
--------------------------------------

Just like you can insert expressions into strings, you can insert expressions into xhtml.
Here is the previous examples rewritten with insertions:
[source,opa]
--------------------------------------
string1 = "First piece"
div = <div class={["something"]}>Hey</div>
string2 = "Third piece"
<> {string1} {div} {string2} </>
--------------------------------------

[NOTE]
============
You can only insert expressions in the content of a tag or the value of expressions, you cannot insert
expressions instead of a tag name for instance.
[source,opa]
------------
tag = "div"
some_xhtml = <{tag}>Hello</> // NOT_VALID
------------
============

In xhtml literals, the usual comments +/* */+ and +//+ do not work anymore.
Instead, you have xhtml comments +<!-- -\->+, which really are comments and not
a structure representing comments (so these comments will never appear at runtime,
you cannot send them to the client etc.).

There are a few attributes that are dealt with specially in xhtml literals.

.Style
The value associated to the style attribute should be of type +Css.properties+.
For convenience, it can be written as a string, just like you would in html files,
but it is _not_ a string and it _will_ be parsed.

.Class
The value associated to the class attribute has a similar behaviour to the one of style.
Its value has the type +list(string)+ but it can be written as a string, that is going to
be parsed.

.Onclick,ondblclick,onmouseup,...
The full list is actually the type of Dom.even.kind.
The value of this attribute is a +FunAction.t+, ie +Dom.event \-> void+.

.Options:onclick, options:ondblclick, ...
The value of this attribute is a +list(Dom.event_option)+.

//do we care?.events
// don't get what it does

Namespaces
^^^^^^^^^^
By default, when you use the syntax for xml literals, you actually build xhtml (the default namespace
is the one of xhtml, some attributes have special meaning, etc.).
This can be disabled by putting a @xml around an xhtml literal.

[source,opa]
--------------------------------------
_ = @xml(<example attr="value"/>)
--------------------------------------

You can build xml with any namespace, not necessarily only the empty one or the one of xhtml.
[source,opa]
--------------------------------------
some_soap = @xml(
 <soap:Envelope
     xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-envelope"
     soap:encodingStyle="http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-encoding">
   <soap:Body xmlns:m="http://www.example.org/stock">
     <m:hello>Hello world</m:hello>
   </soap:Body>
 </soap:Envelope>
)
--------------------------------------

When you define a namespace with a xmlns attribute, the namespace is defined
in the current litteral only. If you insert a piece of html, it must also
defines the namespace:
[source,opa]
--------------------------------------
body = @xml(
   <soap:Body xmlns:m="http://www.example.org/stock">
     <m:hello>Hello world</m:hello>
   </soap:Body>
) // this is not valid because the namespace soap is not in scope
some_soap = @xml(
 <soap:Envelope
     xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-envelope"
     soap:encodingStyle="http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-encoding">
   {body}
 </soap:Envelope>
)
--------------------------------------

To solve this problem and to factorize the namespaces, you can name them with a normal binding:
[source,opa]
--------------------------------------
`xmlns:soap`="http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-envelope"
body = @xml(
   <soap:Body xmlns:m="http://www.example.org/stock">
     <m:hello>Hello world</m:hello>
   </soap:Body>
) // this not valid because `xmlns:soap` is in scope
some_soap = @xml(
 <soap:Envelope
     soap:encodingStyle="http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-encoding">
   {body}
 </soap:Envelope>
)
--------------------------------------

Parser
^^^^^^
Xml is often used as an intermediate structure, and as such, it should be convenient to transform it
into a less generic structure.

Opa features a special pattern matching like constructs that is meant for this:
[source,opa]
--------------------------------------
x = xml_parser
    | <x>parser x=Rule.integer</><y>parser y=Rule.integer</> -> ~{x y}
--------------------------------------

It defines a parser that transforms xml such as
[source,opa]
--------------------------------------
<x>12</x><y>13</y>
--------------------------------------

into

[source,opa]
--------------------------------------
{x=12 y=13}
--------------------------------------

This syntax resembles the one of pattern matching, and it acts the same: +
The xml begin parsed is matched against the patterns in order until a match is found. +
The right hand side of the pattern is then executed.

//ATTENTION avec l'histoire des whitespaces
//When some xml is given to a parser, it first flattens the xml (in case it is a fragment) and it discard text nodes
//that contain only whitespace.
//In the previous example, we get the list +[<x>12</>, <y>13</>]+. +
//The result is then given to the first subrule +<x>parser x=Rule.integer</>+. +
//This subrule binds +x+ to +12+ and return the remaining nodes +[<y>13</>]+. +
//These remaining nodes are then given to the second subrule +<y>parser y=Rule.integer</>+. +
//This subrule binds +y+ to +13+ and return the remaining nodes +[]+. +
//The action corresponding to the pattern is then executed. +

//We detail here the meaning 'a list of xml matches a pattern.'
We detail here how +xml_parser+ patterns behave:


* One rule is composed of a list of patterns. +
Any xml matches the empty list of patterns. Note that the xml doesn't have to be empty.
+
An xml matches a non empty list of patterns if the xml matches the head pattern
and its siblings (if it is a fragment, or the empty fragment otherwise) match the
remaining patterns.

* An xml matches the pattern +parser <parser-prod>++ if its first node is a text
node that is accepted by the parser. +
The bindings done in the parser are in the scope of the action.

* An xml matches the pattern +x=<subrule>+ when the xml matches the <subrule>
and the result of <subrule> is then bound to x.

* An xml matches the pattern +x<suffix>+ when the xml matches
the pattern +x=_<suffix>+

* An xml always matches the subrule +<subrule>*+. +
As many nodes as possible are matched, and the list of results returned by
those matched is returned.

* An xml matches the subrule +<subrule>++ when the xml matches <subrule> at least once. +
As many nodes as possible are matched, and the list of results returned by
those matched is returned.

* An xml always matches the subrule +<subrule>?+. +
A node is matched if possible, and its result wrapped into an option is returned.
If no node is matched, +{none}+ is returned.

* An xml matches the subrule +<subrule>{min,max}+ when the xml matches <subrule> at least
+min+ times. As many nodes as possible (but stopping at +max+) are matched, and the
list the results of these matches is returned.

* An xml matches the subrule +<subrule>\{number}+ when it matches +<subrule>{number,number}+.

* An xml matches the subrule +_+ if it contains at least a node. This node is then returned.

* An xml matches the subrule +{<expr>}+ when the calling the xml_parser <expr> accepts the xml.
 In that case, the result of the xml_parser is returned.

* An xml matches the subrule +<tag attributes>content</>+ when the xml begins with a tag node
and
** the tag of the node match the tag of the pattern
** the attributes of the node match the attributes of the pattern
** the content of the node match the content of the pattern

* A tag matches a tag of a pattern when they have the same namespace and the same name.

* A list of attributes matches a list of attributes pattern when
each attribute
** has no counterpart in the list of attribute pattern
** or has a counterpart in the attribute pattern list
and their value match
+
(a counterpart being an attribute with the same namespace and name)

* An attribute value always matches +_+

* An attribute value always matches the absence of value pattern (+<tag attr=1>+ matches the pattern +<tag attr/>+)
The value of the attribute is bound to name of the attribute.

* An attribute value matches +{ <expr> }+ when the parser +<expr>+ accepts the
value. The return value is bound to the name of the attribute.

* An attribute value matches +<string-literal>+ when it matches +{ Parser.of_string(<string-literal>) }+
The return value is bound to the name of the attribute.

* An attribute value matches +(<value> as <ident>)+ when it matches <value>. +
In that case, the value of the matching is bound to +<ident>+ instead of being bound to the name
of the attribute.

[IMPORTANT]
==================
All whitespace only text nodes are discarded during parsing.
[source,opa]
--------------
xml = @xml(<>"  "</>)
p = xml_parser
    | parser .* -> {}
--------------
+p+ would fail at parsing +xml+, because it behaves exactly as if +xml+ were defined as
[source,opa]
--------------
xml = @xml(<></>)
--------------
==================

//    An xml matches a list of subrules if 
//    Any list of xml matches the empty list pattern. (<></>)
//    A list of xml matches a non empty list pattern if the list of xml matches the head
//    and if the remaining nodes matches the tail pattern.

// 2. A list of xml match a subrule:
   
// A subrule can be:
// - _ : matches exactly one text node or a tag node
//   If the result of this pattern is named, it will have type +xhtml+.
// - <tag attributes> content </>
//   this pattern matches the first node of the list if the first node
//   if a tag node with the same tag, matching attributes and matching content
//   The content is considered to match even where there are remaining nodes in the values
//   that are not matched by the pattern
//   The attributes also match even when there more attributes in the values that in pattern.
//   For instance <div/> matches any tag node with the name div, with any quantity of children
//   and with any attribute.
//   If the result of this pattern is named, it will have type +xhtml+.
// - an expression between curly braces is simply another xml parser that will be called on the
//   current list of nodes (that may read as many nodes as it wishes)
//   If the result of this pattern is named, it will have the return type of parser.
// - parser <parser-rules> matches when the first node of the list is a text node
//   and when the parser successfully parser the content of text node.
//   If the result of this pattern is named, it will have the return type of the parser.
// - If the subrule is omitted, it defaults to _

// An attribute pattern can be:
// - attr=_
//   Matches when the tag node has a the attribute attr, without conditions on its value.
// - attr
//   Matches when the tag node has a the attribute attr, and binds the value to the name +attr+
// - attr=({e} as name)
//   e should be a +Parser.general('a)+ this constructs binds name to the value returned by the parser
//   (of type +'a+)
// - attr=(<string-literal> as name)
//   shorthand for attr=({Parser.of_string(<string-literal>}} as name)
// - attr={e}
//   shorthand for attr=({e} as attr)
// - attr=<string-literal>
//   shorthand for attr=(<string-literal> as attr)


// You can put modifiers on the subrules:
// - subrule* means to match (greedily) as many consecutive +subrule+ as possible
//   If the result of this pattern is named, its type will a be a list of the type returned by subrule.
// - subrule+ means to match (greedily) as many consecutive +subrule+ as possible
//   and the result should be non empty
//   If the result of this pattern is named, its type will a be a list of the type returned by subrule
//   (and the list is guaranteed to be non empty).
// - subrule{min,max} means to match (greedily) up to max consecutive +subrule+,
//   but to fail is less that min were parsed
//   If the result of this pattern is named, its type will a be a list of the type returned by subrule
//   (and the list is guaranteed to be at least min long and at most max long).
// - subrule{number} is a shorthand for subrule{number,number}

Ip address
^^^^^^^^^^

You can write constant ip addresses with the usual syntax:
[source,opa]
--------------------------------------
127.0.0.1
--------------------------------------

This expression has type +IPv4.ip+.

Directives
^^^^^^^^^^

The set of expression directives is extended by the following directives:
=====================
@sliced_expr::
Takes one static record with the field +server+ and +client+ (containing arbitrary expressions) +
Meaning described in the <<slicer,client-server distribution>>.

//@static_content::
//@static_content_directory::
//@static_include_directory::
//@static_source_content::
//@static_binary_content::
@static_resource::
@static_resource_directory::
  TODO

@xml::
Takes an xml literal +
The default namespace in the literal in the empty uri, not the xhtml uri.
=====================

The set of binding directives is also extended:
[[web_binding_directives]]
=====================
@both::
@both_implem::
@client::
@publish::
@publish_async::
Takes no argument, appear at the toplevel or inside toplevel modules +
Meaning described in the <<slicer,client-server distribution>>.

@serializer::
Takes a typename +
Overrides the generic serialization and deserialization for the given type with the pair of functions annotated.

@server::
@server_private::
Takes no argument, appear at the toplevel or inside toplevel modules +
Meaning described in the <<slicer,client-server distribution>>.

@xmlizer::
Takes a typename +
Overrides the generic transformtion to xml for the given type with the function annotated.
=====================

Css
^^^

Opa allows you to define css (as a datastructure) using the syntax of css:
[source,opa]
---------------
mycss = css
body {
  background: white none repeat scroll top left;
  color: #4D4D4D;
}
---------------

Now this is just a datastruture that you can manipulate like any other.
To actually serve it to the clients, you need to register it, which is done
by defining a variable with name +css+ at toplevel.
[source,opa]
---------------
css = [my_css]
---------------
The right hand side should be of type +list(Css.declaration)+.

One exception is that it is allowed to say simply:
[source,opa]
---------------
css = css
body {
  background: white none repeat scroll top left;
  color: #4D4D4D;
}
---------------
The right hand side of css is of type +Css.declaration+, but in the special case when it
is a literal, it gets automatically promoted to a list of one element. +
It allows for a slightly lighter syntax when the css of your application is defined in one block.

To define css in opa, you simply declare a variable with name +css+ at toplevel.

The style attribute of xhtml constructs is also parsed specially. Its content looks like a string
but is actually a structure.
[source,opa]
---------------
<div style="top: 0px; left: 29px; position: absolute; ">
---------------
This structure can be built in expression, you do not need a style attribute to build it:
[source,opa]
---------------
css { top: 0px; left: 29px; position: absolute; }
---------------
The previous div was simply a shorthand for:
[source,opa]
---------------
<div style={ css { top: 0px; left: 29px; position: absolute; } }>
---------------


//css = css css_declaration -> lifted to a list of length one
//    | expr -> of type list(css_declaration)
//css css_map
//css { <style-value> }
//style='<style-value>'
//<int>% // but not available since % is already an expression
//<int> <unit> (type Css.length)
//<float> <unit>
//<color> // but not available since it is parsed as an identifier
//#code couleur // ok car # est pas parsable autrement
//rgb(..,..,..) // pas ok car c'est un appel de fonction d'abord
//url("url") // not available same reason
//url('url') // available because it can not be parsed as a function call
//Css.prop_value_expr_opa

Defining servers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The way to define a server in Opa is to define a toplevel value named +server+, whose right hand side
should be an expression of type +service+.
[source,opa]
--------------------------------------
server = one_page_server("Hello", -> <h1>Hello World</h1>)
--------------------------------------

Id
^^^^
You can use
[source,opa]
--------------------------------------
id = #main // as a shortcut to Dom.select_id("main")
// or equivalently
id = #{"main"} // you can of course put an arbitrary expression
               // (of type string) inside the curly braces
--------------------------------------

This syntax can also be used in xhtml attributes values:
[source,opa]
--------------------------------------
html = <div id=#main>some text</>
--------------------------------------
which is really a way of saying
[source,opa]
--------------------------------------
html = <div id="main">some text</>
--------------------------------------
except that the syntax makes it clear what the string will be used for
since the definition and usage of an id share the same syntax.

Actions
^^^^^^^
Opa features list of actions, which is a small dsl to transform the dom conveniently. +
Note the syntax introduced below is really a structure, it does not execute anything.
+Dom.transform+ must be applied to a list of actions for the actions to be performed
(so that you can build them of the server).

An action lists is just a list of actions, inside square braces and separated by
commas (just like a list, except that it contains actions and not expressions).
An action consist in a selector, a verb and an expression.
The selector can be one of:
[source,opa]
--------------------------------------
.some_static_class_name,
.{some_dynamic_class_name},
#some_static_id,
#{some_dynamic_id}
--------------------------------------
followed optionally by:
[source,opa]
--------------------------------------
-> css // to select the style property
-> some_property // to select any static property (like style, value, etc.)
-> {e} // to select any dynamic property
--------------------------------------

The verb is either +\<-+ for setting the value, ++\<-+ for appending to the
value or +-\<-+ for prepending to the value.

The expression is simply the value that will be set, appended to prepended to whatever is selected. +
When the selector is not followed by +\->+, the expression should be convertible to xhtml. +
When the selector is followed by +\-> value+, the expression should be convertible to string. +
In all other cases, the expression must have type string.

Here is an instance of an action list, that replaces the content of the element
pointed to by +#show_message+ by a fragment of html.

[source,opa]
--------------------------------------
do Dom.transform([#show_messages <- <>{failure}</>])
--------------------------------------
