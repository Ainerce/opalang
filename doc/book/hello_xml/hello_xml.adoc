Hello, XML
----------

The XML family of languages is an important technology for the web, at all
levels.  It structures both web pages, SOAP or WSDL service-oriented application
technologies, but also numerous databases accessible online, e-Book
technologies, social web services, etc. In this chapter, we will rework our
REST-based wiki to make it understand and produce SOAP requests. Along the way,
we will introduce Opa's advanced tools for extracting data from XML or building
XML documents.
