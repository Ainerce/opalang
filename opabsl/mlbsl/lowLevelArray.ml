   Native arrays support.
*)

(**
   This module is the server side implementation of low level array (imperative).
   Do not use for anything. You should probably thing before using this structure
   if it is well-adapted to your need. Maybe a functionnal structure supporting
   parallel computing would be appropriate.

   <!> The directive @@llarray inserted by the compiler is resolved by the Ocaml
   backends to a value of type llarray. Any changes here should be reported as well
   in the backend implementation.

##extern-type llarray('a) = Obj.t array
(* the inner type is masked to avoid generalisation problem wit ocaml *)
(* only works if llarray is exported as a concrete type *)

##register set : llarray('a), int, 'a -> void
(*let set (a:'a llarray) i (v:'a) = Array.unsafe_set a i (Obj.repr v)*)
let set (a:'a llarray) i (v:'a) = a.(i) <- (Obj.repr v)

##register get : llarray('a), int -> 'a
let get (a:'a llarray)  i : 'a = Obj.magic (a.(i))

##register size : llarray('a) -> int
let size a= Array.length a

##register create : int, 'a -> llarray('a)
let create n (v:'a) : 'a llarray =
  let a = Array.make n (Obj.magic 0) in
  for i = 0 to pred n do
    a.(i) <- (Obj.repr v)
  done;
  a

##register concat : llarray('a), llarray('a) -> llarray('a)
(* here, we cannot use normal Array.append because with explicit
   closures, we may have an etherogeneous array, and this would segfault
   if the first item is a float. *)
let concat a1 a2 = Base.Array.append_memory a1 a2
