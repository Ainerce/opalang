/**
  This file provides prototypes for function added by side effect to jQuery by
  opabsl/jsbsl/jquery-1.X.Y.js. We use the jquery-1.6.externs.js version of the
  JS prototypes from Google. The present file fills the holes and may
  become useless if the Google's prototype file gets updated to a more recent
  version. This code is not intended to be compiled and included in any binary,
  it only serves to the Google Closure Compiler checker by giving it prototypes,
  hence avoiding warnings.  In case the Google Closure Compiler checker is not
  more used by the build system, this source file can be discarded from the Opa
  sources tree.  This source file is involved by the build system build_rules.ml
  for 2 rules: - rule "Client lib JS validation" - rule "opa-bslgenMLRuntime JS
  validation"
