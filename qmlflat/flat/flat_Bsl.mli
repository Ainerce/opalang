   The module should be restarted before each compilation unit
*)

module ML_CTrans : BslInterface.ML_CTRANS

val build_ctrans_env :

  Qml2ocamlOptions.argv_options ->
  ML_CTrans.env

(**
   In the ctrans_env there is a map of seg-fault bypass.t
   collected during the projection (not give the error directly,
   and fail at bypass resolution only if this bypass is used)

   Currently the string is a message of error, None if no error.

   TODO: clean-up, use QmlError, etc...
