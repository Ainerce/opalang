   Flat Compiler : Static record generation
   @author Mathieu Barbin
*)

(**
   The compilation process perform already some side-effects
   about the sharing variables (fiels, vtable, and simple).

   So, the generated expression may contain unbound variables.
   Those variables are introduced using the module [Flat_Shared].

   Other generated variable are in Flat_Cache.
   This is possible to insert them between toplevel expression.
*)

type label = Flat_Common.label


(**
   The initializer is used only if we know statically that we are dealing with a non-empty
   and a non-simple record. If not, the init is not static.
*)
val static_init :
  is_lazy:bool ->
  info:Ocaml.expr option ->
  (label * Ocaml.expr) list ->
  Ocaml.expr

(**
   Optimized initializer for potential simple record.
   <!> Beware, if the record is simple the info will be discarded.
