    This module provides functions to make connections, secured or not,
    by listening or connecting on a port specification.
    Connection returned by those functions, of type [Scheduler.connection_info],
    should then be used with the Scheduler module.

    {b Current use:}
    For the moment it is used only to establish TCP connection (connected mode).
    {b Intented future use:}
    UPD specific function may be added in that module
