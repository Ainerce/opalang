(**
 *   This module introduces a notion of a cluster. A cluster is a bunch
 * of servers, where each server is uniquely identified.
 *   ClusterComm module builds on that and provides primitives for
 * communication within a cluster.
 *)

(**
 * A unique identification of a server. All operations where a server
 * needs to be identified use this type.
 *)
(* FIXME, include cluster footprint in [node_id], so that it cannot be
 * mixed up with sids from other clusters? *)
type node_id

(**
 * A total order on machine identifiers
 *)
module NodeOrder : (Abstr.SafeOrderedType with type t = node_id)

module NodeSet : (BaseSetSig.S with type elt = node_id)
type nodeset = NodeSet.t

module NodeMap : (BaseMapSig.S with type key = node_id)
type 'a nodemap = 'a NodeMap.t

(**
 * A type of a cluster (i.e. a collection of servers)
 *)
type t

type addr = Unix.sockaddr

(**
 * Initializes a cluster. Takes an address of the machine running
 * this function and of all the other machines in the cluster.
 *
 * WARNING: all the machines in a cluster must run this function
 * consistently (i.e. with the same group of addresses), which then
 * ensures that the process identifiers will be unique and correct.
 *)
(* FIXME, This of course is no good, big time. In the future we want
   a less painful way to set-up a cluster & in the long run,
   we want a cluster with re-configuration capabilities. *)
val init : ?me:addr -> addr list -> t

(**
 * Returns the [node_id] of the server it is run on.
 *)
exception MeUnknown
val me : t -> node_id

(**
 * Gives the [node_id]s of all the servers in the cluster
 *)
val all_server_ids : ?including_myself:bool -> t -> node_id list

(**
 * Gives a sid of a random server from the cluster.
 *)
val random_server_id : ?including_myself:bool -> t -> node_id

val get_addr : t -> node_id -> addr

val get_id : t -> addr -> node_id

(**
 * Gives the number of servers in the cluster
 * [servers_no () = List.length (all_servers ())], but may be
 * more efficient
 *)
val servers_no : ?including_myself:bool -> t -> int

(**
 * Converts [node_id] to integer... Paxos presentation assumes that [node_id]s
 * from a cluster are mapped to ints: 0..n-1 where [n] is the size of the cluster.
 *)
val node_id_to_int : node_id -> int

(**
 * Mainly for debugging.
 * Converts a [node_id] to a human-readable string, with server name and port.
