   Simple file access library which provides a minimal
   set of file and directory access functions but
   maintains a list of authorized directories.  Only
   directories which are prefixed by one of the authorized
   dirs are valid.

(** remove_valid_folder folder:
    Remove the given folder from the valid folder list.
    The name of the folder must match exactly, ie. "tmp/"
    will not match "tmp".
    If the current directory is a subdir of the one being
    removed then the current dir is set to the first folder
    in the valid folder list.
    Note that this might not result in removing access to
    the given directory if one of its parents is still in
    the list.
    WARNING: If the last valid folder is removed then the
    current dir is technically in an unsafe state since
    there is currently no way of flagging the non-existence
    of the current dir.
