(** This module ensures consistency when using the dispatcher prototype by
    * making sure all parents exists when writing a node
    * reading from the root to detect links

    NB: there is a huge overcost. This is not meant to last, but to have a
    working dispatcher ASAP and then focus on optimisations.
