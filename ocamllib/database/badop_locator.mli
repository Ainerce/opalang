(** This module provides a mapping between database paths (Badop.path) and
    servers. It holds the [cluster_map], which guides this mapping and should be
    shared among all db nodes. *)
(**
   What you have here is a temporary place-holder until a real locator is
   implemented. Features wanted:

   - adding servers before completing initialisation (until a fixed number is
     reached -- like db4). This requires some network communication (directly or
     via a monitor ?)
   - dynamic cluster_map with update/add/remove...
   - cluster_map synchronisation
*)
