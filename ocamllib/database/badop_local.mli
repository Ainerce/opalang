(** Binding of the local db3 db backend to the generic db interface Badop.

    Remarks:

    Of all the transaction operations, only [prepare] can execute
    its continuation asynchronously, as soon as previous, blocking commits
    are done with. If the preparation fails, the continuations is still
    executed, with the boolean value at [false], indicating failure.

    The abort operation, in case of prepared transactions, does not
    only abort them, but rolls back any state changes done by prepare.
    This functionality is not reflected in the name, because it may only
    be useful if a timeout expired between prepare and commit operation
    and only if we decide to rollback and not commit in such a situation.
    Still, this functionality is nice for low-level tests of rollbacks.

    The [read (Badop.Revisions)] query, for now, should return all revisions
    for a deleted node and only revisions since the last deletion for
    a live node. To be changed in the future.
