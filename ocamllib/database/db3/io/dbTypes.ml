   Database structures.

*)

(**
   These types are used to represent the database in memory.
   Each kind of db-file is represented by a structure.
   These types are the interface between the phyisicall database,
   (IoManager) and the rest of the modules working on the database.

   These definitions was historically in [IoManager] but are better in
   this file without mli.
*)

type eid = Eid.t
type uid = Uid.t
type rev = Revision.t

(**
   Used for caching size of some lists, or maps
*)
type size = int

(**
   A position in a file. (in octet)
*)
type position = int

(** {6 Path} *)

(**
   The item of a path.
*)
type key = Keys.t

(**
   A db path
*)
type path = Path.t

(** {6 Datas} *)

(**
   Low level data
*)
type dataimpl = DataImpl.t

(**
   Content of a node.
*)
type data = Datas.t

(** {6 Nodes} *)

(**
   There are two sort of nodes:
   - the concrete node, containing all its infos, and datas.
   - just a diff between its last revision, and its current state.

   The delta nodes may be transformed into full nodes.
*)

(**
   Structure representing the file containing all the database nodes.
*)

(**
   Structure representing the arborescence of nodes in the database.
   and the index.
*)
type dbstate = {
  uidmap : uidmap ;
  index : index ;
}

(** {6 Queries} *)

(**
   Queries are intermidiate actions not yet performed on the database,
   stored in a transaction. Queries are applied to the database
   when the transaction is commited.
*)

type querymap = QueryMap.t

(** {6 Transactions} *)

type trans = {
  querymap : querymap ;
  read_only : bool ;
  remove_list : path list ;
}

(**
   Structure representing the file containing all the transactions.
*)
type transfile = trans list

(**
   Structure representing the file containing all the end positions
   in the other files.

   FIXME: change for a record.


 * - uid_rev position
 * - uid position
 * - node position
 * - timestamps position
 * - trans position

(**
   Structure representing the last indexes used for unicity.
   Stored to avoid clashes during the generation of fresh indexes.

  rev : rev
}

(**
   Configuration of the database.

   - Version of the database (db3 runtime).
   Used to know if the binaries of the database needs changes.

   - Snapshot: index of the last physical state of the database.
   This index may be smaller than the last Revision number if
   there are still transaction to replay. (e.g crash)
*)
