/**
 * {1 About this module}
 *
 * Opa exception are used internally by generated code to report error,
 * but it is discouraged to use them in a standard code.
 *
 * A next version of Opa will have a support for typing and extending exceptions.
 * Currently, exceptions are available only on server side, and are all unified
 * as there were inhabitant of the same sum type, as long as the compiler find
 * occurrences of @catch and @throw in the code.
 *
 * This module contains the definition of the most common exceptions.
 *
 * Raised on the server side, this will either executed the handler code if there
 * is any, or print an uncaught Opa exception message error.
 *
 * Raised on the client side, this will end up with an uncaught Javascript OpaException error.
 * For rpc the client Opa exception should contain a JSon representation of the corresponding
 * Opa exception.
 *
 * The syntax is the same as a [match with], with the [try catch] keywords instead.
 *
 * {[
 * try
 *   expr
 * catch
 *   | { e } ->
 * }
 *
 * {1 Where should I start?}
 *
 * {1 What if I need more?}
