 * This module defines the type of the argument of the directive @deprecated

 * These arguments are read at compile time, and should use literal only.

 * {1 Where should I start?}
 *
 * Here are some example of use:
 *
 * {[
 *   @deprecated({use="bar"}) foo = bar
 * }
 *
 * {[
 *   @deprecated({hint="Please refactor your code, this function does no longer exists"}) foo = ...
 * }
 *
 * {1 What if I need more?}
