   * Atomic compare-and-swap operation
   *
   * This operation is used to develop concurrent non-blocking algorithms. It is used to replace the content of a reference,
   * but only if the content still holds the latest value known to have been put in this reference. If no concurrent unit has
   * modified the value in the meantime, or if the previous value has been restored, the reference is updated with the new
   * value. Otherwise, nothing happens.
   *
   * Important note: This operation checks for {e physical equality}.
   *
   * @param r A reference
   * @param candidate A value that the current execution expects to see in [r]
   * @param replacement A value that the current execution wishes to put in [r]
   *  @return [true] If the value of [r] was physically equal to [candidate], in which case the new value of [r] is now set to [replacement] / [false] otherwise
