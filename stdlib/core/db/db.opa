/**
 * {1 About this module}
 *
 * This module defines the primitive types and functions for persistent data handling,
 * as well as utility functions on data. It contains all database functions that are
 * not built-in.
 *
 * {1 Where do I start?}
 *
 * Check the type definitions for data paths. A {!val_path} is a data that
 * have been read from the database and holds database-specific information, allowing
 * specific operations on them (like full-text searches). A {!ref_path} or reference
 * path, is a pointer to the database that can be passed as argument to a function and
 * written to.
 *
 * {1 What if I need more?}
 *
 * The functions that take reference paths as arguments either perform side-effects on
 * them ({!Db.write}, {!Db.remove}), or use them without being bound to the current version of
 * the database ({!Db.history}). Also included are low-level functions for handling database
 * transactions.
 *
