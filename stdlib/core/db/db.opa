/**
 * {1 About this module}
 *
 * This module defines the primitive types and functions for persistent data handling,
 * as well as utility functions on data. It contains all database functions that are
 * not built-in.
 *
 * {1 Where do I start?}
 *
 * Check the type definitions for data paths. A {!val_path} is a data that
 * have been read from the database and holds database-specific information, allowing
 * specific operations on them (like full-text searches). A {!ref_path} or reference
 * path, is a pointer to the database that can be passed as argument to a function and
 * written to.
 *
 * {1 What if I need more?}
 *
 * The functions that take reference paths as arguments either perform side-effects on
 * them ({!Db.write}, {!Db.remove}), or use them without being bound to the current version of
 * the database ({!Db.history}). Also included are low-level functions for handling database
 * transactions.
 *

/**
 * Value paths
 *
 * Value paths are obtained with the syntax [!/path/to/data]. They are used by most
 * read operations present in this interface, and are bound to a point in time and to
 * the currently running transaction, if any -- this is by opposition to reference
 * paths.
 *
 * That means that binding [p = !/path] and later on [x = Db.read(p)] will give you
 * the value at the time of the binding, just like with [p = /path] and then [x = p].

 *
 * Reference paths are not bound to any time or transaction, and reading them gives the
 * result at the time of the read: by opposition to value paths, [p = @/path] followed
 * later on by [x = Db.read(p)] will show any change on the value stored in the database
