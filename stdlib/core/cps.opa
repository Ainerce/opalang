 * {1 About this module}
 *
 * With the apparition of {[ @callcc : ( continuation('a) -> void ) : void }
 * there is a need for the user to apply a continuation to a value of type ['a]
 *
 * Since the continuation will also be the native support of transactions,
 * there is a need for an API.

 * {1 Where should I start?}
 *
 * {1 What if I need more?}
