 * MongoMap = {{

 * MongoTree = {{
 *   // Implementation of Tree using underlying MongoDB.
 *   // Note that there is an interesting page on the MongoDB
 *   // website on embedding trees in MongoDB:
 *   // http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Trees+in+MongoDB

 * 
 * Db = {{
 *   - This will look like the current Db module (as far as we can implement it).  Mostly you
 *     will get: read/write/remove/{int/string}map_search/{int/string}map_fold_range.  Note that
 *     implementing history with MongoDB could prove heavy-weight and potentially disastrous
 *     for performance although I'm sure it could be done.  A primitive form of transaction,
 *     however, might be a good option.  Modification time could be handled low-level in
 *     the driver at the expense of some peformance.
