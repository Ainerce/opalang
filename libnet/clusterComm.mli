 * this function and of all the other machines in the cluster.
 *
 * WARNING: all the machines in a cluster must run this function
 * consistently (i.e. with the same group of addresses), which then
 * ensures that the process identifiers will be unique and correct.

   a less painful way to set-up a cluster & in the long run,
   we want a cluster with re-configuration capabilities. *)
