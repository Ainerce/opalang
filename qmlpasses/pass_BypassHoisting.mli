(**
   Eta expand, hoist (lift) and share bypass of the code.

(**
   This pass defines for each bypass used in the code a toplevel
   definition which corresponds to the eta expansion of the bypass.

   It also replaces every occurrence of the bypass by the corresponding
   toplevel identifier just defined.

   Eta-expansion is based on the types provided by the bypass typer function (libbsl)
   (as much lambdas as arrows in the type)

   Some simplification for the generated code :

   + the pass is idempotent, thanks to the directive \@expanded_bypass
   + when the definition at top level of a bypass is the first utilisation of it,
     do the eta-expension in place.
   + remove local alias of bypass, using the top-level identifier instead.

   This pass has 2 mode, typed or not typed.

   Example:

   {[
   plus = %%+%%
   succ x = %%+%% x 1
   toto =
     p = %%+%% in
     p 4 5
   ]}

   is rewritten in

   {[
   plus = x, y -> %%+%% x y
   succ x = plus x 1
   toto = plus 4 5
   ]}

   If the option [just_expand] is set, do not hoist the bypass, just
   do the expand in place, insering the directive \@expanded_bypass.
