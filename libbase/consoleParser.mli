(**
   Console Parser for interpreters.

   @author Mathieu Barbin
*)

(**
   This module is a simple tool for accumulating an input of the user,
   until it parse a toplevel separator [";;"].

   This is used in [qmltop], [qmlcompilers].

   There is a support for compilers or interpreters directives,
   this is about any separated line beginning with a sharp,
   as in
   {[
   v = 5
   ;;
   #typer off;;
   etc...
   ]}

   Comment:

   + any thing in the same line than the semicolon separator is removed
   {[
   g = "toto" ;; this is a comment removed by the console parser
   ]}
*)

(** {6 Known bug} *)

(**
   This approch has some negative points :
   + it behave very badly if a string or a comment contains a toplevel separator [";;"]

*)

(** {6 Console Parser} *)
(**
   Some infos about the implementation :
   + Use an intern imperative Buffer

   + it performs a [String.rtrim] on the input.
*)

(**
   The type of a console parser. Statefull
*)
type t

(**
   Create a new console parser
*)
val create : unit -> t

(**
   The type of a parsed entity.

   In case a directive is parsed, the sharp char is keeped in the returned string.
*)
type input = Directive of string | Code of string

(** Reseting the state of the internal Buffer *)
val reset : t -> unit

(**
   Accumulate a line, a return possibly something, or just accumulate the input.

   The accumulate function will add a newline to the Buffer.
   <!> The new line char should not be given to the string.

   Typically, the correct use is :
   {[
   while true do
     match ConsoleParser.accumulate (input_line stdin) with
     | Some (ConsoleParser.Directive s) ->
     | Some (ConsoleParser.Code s) ->
     | None ->
   done
   ]}
*)
val accumulate : t -> string -> input option

(** Flush the last input. It is like [accumulate ";;"] *)
val flush : t -> input option


module Directive :
sig
  (** {6 Support for directives} *)

  (**
     Directives in an interpreter are a way to interact with the it,
     e.g. to modify a global property or an option once the loop is already started.

     The syntax for directives is defined by the [ConsoleParser], which is used
     in the interpreter for parsing the input.

     {[
     #directives [arguments] ;;
     ]}

     A directive can for example just modify the state of the interpreter, by modifying
     some option related to its behavior (like [#typer on/off]) or enrich the environment
     , as in [#load <file>].

     The interface of directives is : [extra-arguments -> env -> directives arguments -> env],
     so that we can handle all possible cases. (the env returned should be the same as the
     input env in case of just a switch of a property.)
  *)

  type arguments = string list
  type 'env action = 'env -> arguments -> 'env

  (**
     For parsing directive, we use a regexpr collection.
     All regexp are successively used to match the input.
     Then, we apply the first matching regexp action.
  *)

  type regexp = string
  type argument_number = int

  type 'env directive = regexp * argument_number * 'env action

  type 'env handler
  val empty : unit -> 'env handler
  val add : 'env handler -> 'env directive -> 'env handler
  val parse : 'env handler -> 'env -> string -> 'env option
end
