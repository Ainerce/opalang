   Hashtbl with sorted wrt their input order.

(**
   this structure comes when :
   + you don't need to remove elt, (just replace)
   + you want to find quickly elt from keys
   + you want to preserve input ordered in iter and fold
   + you need both rev and normal quick and tail
   + you dont care about the size of the table. (we use several redondant
   structures for keeping the tail recusive for folding in both direction)
