(** {6 Argument} *)

(** A module for manipulating nodes of your graph *)
module type ItemType =
sig
  (** The type of a node of your graph. *)
  type t

  (**
     Indexing nodes of your graph.
     The function [index] should be injective.
  *)
  val index : t -> string

  (**
     Given a node of the graph, return the list of index
     of the direct parents.
  *)
  val depends : t -> string list
end

(** {6 Functor} *)

(** The module you'll get for proceding to the topologic sort *)
module type S =
sig

  (**
     The type of the nodes. This is the same type as
     defined in the module in argument of [Make].
  *)
  type t

  (**
     raised if one of the [t] is in a cyclic dependency loop.
  *)
  exception CyclicDep of t

  (**
     raised if 2 [t] of the input list of [sort] have
     the same index.
  *)
  exception IndexConflict of t * t

  (**
     raised by computing the transitive_dependencies, in case
     the given [t] in not previously in the list given for
     computing the env
  *)
  exception Not_found_index of string

  (**
     Stable topologic sort.
     The function return a sorted list wrt a topologic order of elements of [t].
     The second elt returned is the list of [not_referenced] nodes.
     For each non referenced node [index] (we have only the index), we give the list
     of [nodes] which have declared index as a depends.

  val sort : t list -> t list * (string * t list) list

  val compute : t list -> env

  (**
     Like sort, in case you do not want to recompute everything
     e.g. from a previous env.
  *)
  val get_order : env -> t list * (string * t list) list

  (**
     Not reflexive.
