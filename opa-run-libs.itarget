# This file lists all libs that are LINKED to opa servers.
# As a consequence, opa needs their interface.
# (libs that are linked indirectly, eg used by the libs here
# but not directly by the server, can safely be skipped and
# put in opa-compile-libs.itarget)

# Caution: used by many scripts, in particular, make_distrib.sh
