   This pass registers all the source code of the application (all the files
   and their content) to a BSL module BslAppSrcCode. This module then
   exposes those sources to the server, which makes a default web-page
   /_internal_/src_code presenting the source code of the application.

   Collecting original sources is accomplished by the earlier pass
   GatherAppSrcCode.
