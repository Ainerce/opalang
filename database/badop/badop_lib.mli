(** This module contains common types, functions and helpers used throughout the
    badop interface and implementations ; it's a generic lib for queries, cps
    and stuff, all db-specific stuff is in badop.ml *)

(** {4 The dialog type and handlers} *)

(** we provide a private [dialog] type that is a either-or of two types with
    safe access functions (using a phantom type).
    - [(query,'q,'r) dialog] holds (only) a data of type 'q. Build it with function [query]
    - [(response,'q,'r) dialog] holds (only) a data of type 'r. Extract it with function [response]

*)

type ('which, 'q, 'r) dialog = private
  | Query of 'q
  | Response of 'r

module Dialog : sig
  type query (** phantom type *)
  type response (** phantom type *)
  type ('which, 'q, 'r) t = ('which, 'q, 'r) dialog = private
    | Query of 'q
    | Response of 'r

  (** Builds a query *)
  val query: 'q -> (query, 'q, 'r) t

  (** Extracts a response *)
  val response: (response, 'q, 'r) t -> 'r
end

(** This one is used by backends, not exported outside of the lib *)
module Dialog_aux : sig
  (** Turns a query into response (only for use by database engines) *)
  val respond: (Dialog.query, 'q, 'r) dialog -> 'r -> (Dialog.response, 'q, 'r) dialog

  (** Used to transform queries (eg when forwarding) (only for use by database engines) *)
  val map_dialog: query:('q1 -> 'q2 Cps.t) -> response:('r1 -> 'r2 Cps.t) ->
    ('which, 'q1, 'r1) dialog -> ('which, 'q2, 'r2) dialog Cps.t
