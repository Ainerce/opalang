(** This module provides a mapping between database paths (Badop.path) and
    servers. It holds the [cluster_map], which guides this mapping and should be
    shared among all db nodes. *)
(**
   What you have here is a temporary place-holder until a real locator is
   implemented. Features wanted:

   - adding servers before completing initialisation (until a fixed number is
     reached -- like db4). This requires some network communication (directly or
     via a monitor ?)
   - dynamic cluster_map with update/add/remove...
   - cluster_map synchronisation
*)

    asynchronous (run in parallel using the scheduler) *)

(** Functions to manipulate the locator structure. Keys are obtained from
    [mapi], [mapi_path], etc. and can be used to get the corresponding
    element from another locator. *)
