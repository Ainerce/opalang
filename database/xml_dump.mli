(** This module provides a facility for generating an XML tree that follows the
    structure of an OPA database. It first extracts the schema from that
    database (as saved by OPA programs thanks to dbGen), then uses it to follow
    the data and to structure the XML. XML dump format is documented in the opa
    stdlib.

    See also Xml_import, that loads back the same XML format into a database.
