   This module provide a layer to execute functions

*)

(*
 It catches:
  - errors (eg. nothing to read, connection closed...)
  - system break (ctrl-c)
  - other unexpected exceptions

 The general contract is
      - to never crash on executing
        external *and* internal functions
        inside the scheduler
      - to provide, when an error occure,
        a usefull log message for debugging purpose
      - to provide, when the scheduler debug mode is off,
        a least the right backtrace in the console
