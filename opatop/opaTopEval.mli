   OpaTop expressions evaluation, kernel of the interpreter.

(** {6 Errors reporting} *)

(**
   This module uses [OManager].
   Currently, the positions are not available, so any runtime errors try to print
   some AST.
   This does no follows the guidelines, and should be fixed when the positions will be
   available in QmlAst, as position 0 of any constructor (this is a TODO in QmlAst).
*)

(** {6 Evalulation} *)

(**
   Note about bypasses:

   For building bypasses, we use the API provided by OpaTopBsl.
   In particular, this can work only if the corresponding plugins have arleady
   been loaded, and primitives registred. This is guaranty if you use the interpreter
   via the command line tool, but you have to be carrefully if you use the interpreter
   as a library.

   TODO(refactoring):
   type env = OpaTopValue.t IdentMap.t
*)

type env = OpaTopValue.t IdentMap.t

val eval : env -> QmlAst.expr -> OpaTopValue.t

(** {6 AnnotMap for Values} *)

(**
   For evaluating val rec, we use the unvalrec trick,
   these imperative maps are update by side-effect during
   each call to [eval].

   The map is never read by this module.
