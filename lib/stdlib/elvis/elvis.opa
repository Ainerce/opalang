/**
 * An elvis ("element of vision") is a data structure that can be displayed in the browser screen.
 * Elvises are abstract data structures, characterized by the events they can post (the "sources")
 * and their accessors.
 *
 * ** Relationships between Elvises and Xhtml
 *   - elvises are not xhtml (although they are certainly implemented as such)
 *   - elvises are not referenced by their ID
 *   - for display, elvises are inserted into xhtml
 *   - styling, positioning, etc. are done with CSS and selectors, through the indirection of the [Styler] widget
 *   - DOM events are used to implement Elvis, but they are low-level informations, not meant to be seen outside the Elvis
 *
 * ** Events
 *   - each Elvis publishes a number of [source]s, corresponding the events it can send
 *   - a channel or a function can be registered to listen on a [source], and possibly unregistered later
 *   - an Elvis MUST NOT listen to its own [source]s
 *
 * ** Implementation guidelines
 *   - Each xhtml node in an Elvis should have a class name
 */
