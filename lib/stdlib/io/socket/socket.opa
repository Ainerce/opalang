/**
    {1 About this module}

    ``Low-level'' network module.

    This module helps you to do some low-level networking. You can
    connect to a server, and write and read raw data to/from it.

    The err_cont functions are exactly the same as the non-err_cont
    functions except you get an outcome of either the success result or
    a failure with the exception turned into a string.  Timeouts are
    ints as milliseconds.

    {b Warning:} This module is still experimental.
