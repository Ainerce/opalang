/**
 * {1 About this module}
 *
 * This module defines the primitive type of dbset and functions for
 * manipulate this kind of data.
 *
 * {1 Where do I start?}
 *
 * {2 Path declaration}
 *
 * On the first step define a multiple keys path like that :
 * [db /myset[a;b] : {a : int; b : string; c : int}]
 *
 * This declaration define a path to a dbset that contains data of
 * type [{a : int; b : string; c : int}] indexed by the keys [a] and
 * [b].
 *
 * {2 Data(s) access}
 *
 * Actually you can access to path by 2 ways, in the two case you
 * access with a virtual path.
 *
 * On both ways the write access take a record that contains all
 * fields of the stored data type unless the keys which are already
 * binded.
 *
 *
 * The read access differs if you give a full key, or just a partial
 * key. Indeed if you give a full key the read returns a single value,
 * else the read returns a dbset value.
 *
 * {3 Examples }
 *
 * {[
 *   /* Access with a full key */
 *   @/myset[a=1; b="opa"] : virtual_ref_path({a:int; b:string; c:int},
 *                                            {b:string; c : int})
 *   /* Access with a partial key */
 *   @/myset[a=1] : virtual_ref_path(dbset({a:int; b:string; c:int}),
 *                                   {b:string; c : int})
 *
 *   /* And of course, all syntactic sugar on path works */
 *   !/myset[a=1; b="opa"] : virtual_val_path({a:int; b:string; c:int})
 *
 *   !/myset[a=1] : virtual_val_path(dbset({a:int; b:string; c:int}))
 *
 *   /myset[a=1; b="opa"] : {a:int; b:string; c:int}
 *
 *   /myset[b="opa"] : dbset({a:int; b:string; c:int})
 * }
 *
 * {1 What if I need more?}
 *
 * TODO (Access with range, etc.)
