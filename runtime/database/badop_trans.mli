(** A layer than adds transaction support. Designed to work with a stack
    with the Badop_sync layer (which has only primitive transaction support)
    at the bottom, possibly with a clien-server link in-between.
    Should not be used on top of expensive transactions, such as those
    in Badop_local. Otherwise it's inefficient, because the transactions
    of the lower layers are aggregated in large numbers within the higher
    level transactions, just as primitive DB write operations.

    This is WIP. For now we know and subvert the structure of the lower layer.
