exception InvalidCertificate
(** Exception raised when the certificate provided is invalid *)

(** Certificate to provide.
    When an entity (client or server) asks for a certificate,
    provide this certificate.
    @see <http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_CTX_use_certificate.html> for certificate
    The password field is only used if the private key file is password protected,
    and if it's not an empty string
    If it asks for intermediate CAs, give those in certfile then in certpath
    @see <http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations.html> for CA *)
type ssl_certificate

(** Certificates verifications rules.
    When an entity (client or server) provides a certificate,
    verify the certificate is valid :
    - cafile checks if the certificate is signed by this ca
    - capath checks if the certificate is signed by one of the ca in the ca path
    - certpath checks if the certificate is contained in the cert path
    - accept_fun the function to call if the certificate is unknown/invalid
    The verifications are made in this order :
    - ca check (see http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations.html and http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_load_client_CA_file.html)
    - cert check, if it's in the cert path directory
    - accept_fun if a cert path is defined and the certificate is not in this directory *)
