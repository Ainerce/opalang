   Native ident analysis.
   Replace local native ident to global native ident when they are not
   local to the considered code elt.
*)
val globalize_native_ident : JsAst.code_elt -> JsAst.code_elt

(**
   Prefix every global identifier by "global.". Converts declarations
   so that they still make sense, i.e.

     var foo = bar; -> global.foo = bar;

   Handle also corner cases such as replacing a real export

     exports.foo = foo; -> global.foo = foo;
