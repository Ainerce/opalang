   The javascript lexer

   Beware that the lexer is stateful, so it should not be used
   by several threads simultaneously, nor should you try to intersperse
   the lexing of several inputs

   This module is not meant to be called directly, use instead the high level
   functions provided in jsParse if you want to parse some javascript.
