   Flat Compiler : Compile time sharing, and runtime sharing generation
   @author Mathieu Barbin

(**
   Those function returns the identifier which will be generated in the generated code,
   corresponding to the sharing version of the correspondant value.

   During the compilation, at any moment, we can call these function for accessing
   the identifier.

   At the end, we reintroduce all the binding at the beginning of the generated code.

type label = Flat_Common.label

   FIXME !
   Ocaml Ast should distinguish between top level binding and expressions.

  (**
     For outputting the code, you can introduce them in any order
     because the sharing is done at runtime (separated compilation)

     [all] give all the declaration.

     To avoid multiple declaration, the internal state is modified when
     you get ocaml_val definitions.

     Insert the definition before an existing list.
     More efficient than a list concatenation.
