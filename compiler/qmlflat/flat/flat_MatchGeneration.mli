   Flat Compiler : Pattern Matching generation
   @author Mathieu Barbin
*)

(**
   With the new compositional qmlflat, there are some optimization possible for compiling,
   pattern matching, based in particular on array matching with OCaml, and vtable sharing.

   match record with
   | {a} -> e_a
   | {b} -> e_b
   | x -> e_x
   ]}
   {[
   match record with
   | v when v == shared_record_a -> e_a
   | v when v == shared_record_b -> e_b
   | x -> e_x
   ]}

     This is the cases handled by the generation.
     We use this private type for ensuring statically that the correct function
     of generation is applied to the correct kind of matching.
     We also use this type for making possible an internal traduction of patterns into
     a private algebra, hidden by the abstraction, and handled by the generation modules.

  type closed

  type t =
    | Trivial of trivial
    | Closed of closed
    | Mixed of mixed

     Given the expression we are matched, and the pattern list with right-side
     production, return the analysed pattern matching, ready for generation.

     TODO: for optimization, add [gamma] and [ty] as argument
