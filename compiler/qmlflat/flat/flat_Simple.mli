   Flat Compiler : Simple Record generation
   @author Mathieu Barbin
*)

(**
   Compile time management of simple record generation.
   The type flatruntime.record is shared in case of simple records.
   As long as we need to introduce new simple record in the code,
   we use this module for getting either the shared record,
   which means its definition, and the variable for accessing it.
*)

(**
   The type you should give for building a vtable.
   The expr is on ocaml expression containing an identifier
   pointing on the shared field corresponding to the label.
*)
type label = Flat_Field.label

val simple : label -> Flat_Common.shared_variable

(**
   The module should be restarted before each compilation unit.
*)
val reset : unit -> unit
