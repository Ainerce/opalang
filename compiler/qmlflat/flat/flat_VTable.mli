   Flat Compiler : VTable generation
   @author Mathieu Barbin
*)

(**
   Compile time management of vtable generation.
   The type flatruntime.VTable.t can be shared.
   As long as we need to introduce new vtalbe in the code,
   we use this module for getting either a new vtable, which means
   its definition, and the variable for accessing it.
*)

(**
   The type you should give for building a vtable.
   The expr is on ocaml expression containing an identifier
   pointing on the shared field corresponding to the label.
*)
type vtable = Flat_Field.label list

val vtable :
  vtable ->
  Flat_Common.shared_variable

(**
   The module should be restarted before each compilation unit.
*)
val reset : unit -> unit
