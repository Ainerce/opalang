   Flat Compiler : Dot generation
   @author Mathieu Barbin
*)

(**
   Depending on what do we know at compile time (typer), the
   strategy of dot generation is different. In goes from
   a dichotomic search (without any optimization) to a direct access.

   The compilation process perform already some side-effects
   about the sharing variables (fiels, vtable, and simple).

   The dot may introduce extra caches, and we may want to keep them
   not too far from new val.
   It is possible get the caches at any moment by flushing the
   module [Flat_Cache]. In this may, we may choose to put them
   at toplevel in the beginning of the code, or between toplevel values
   if wanted.
