   Flat Compiler : Field generation
   @author Mathieu Barbin
*)

(**
   Compile time management of field generation.
   The type flatruntime.Field.t is a shared string.
   As long as we need to introduce new fields in the code,
   we use this module for getting either a new field, which means
   its definition, and the variable for accessing it.
*)

(**
   The type of label of field, as in QmlAst
*)
type label = string

val label : label -> Flat_Common.shared_variable

(**
   The module should be restarted before each compilation unit.
*)
val reset : unit -> unit
