   OpaTop global properties.
   @author Mathieu Barbin
*)

(**
   Global properties are a collection of imperative statefull variables
   of toggleling the behavior of the interpreter.

   It is used essentially for debug.
*)

(**
   GUIDELINES: keep alphabetic order of properties.
   For toggle variables (modes) names are [property_set, property_get].

   If it makes sense, add a corresponding directive for a dynamic switch
   in OpaTopDirectives, and add a corresponding option in the command line
   tool.

   Default is on.
